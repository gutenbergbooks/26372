<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A MYSTERIOUS DEATH</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;He is dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson felt the grip of the speaker&#8217;s
hand on his arm and started involuntarily.
How could this strange fellow know that Frank
Langlois was dead&mdash;if he was dead? And was
he? They were surrounded by inky blackness.
It was the thick darkness of a subterranean cavern,
a mine. This was a gold mine. Three
minutes ago their electric torch had flickered
out and they had been unable to make it flash
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;mon,&#8221; said the other man, &#8220;Pant,&#8221; as the
laborers called him, &#8220;we don&#8217;t need that thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>To his utter astonishment, Johnny had felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
himself urged forward by this Pant with the
easy, steady, forward march of one who is certain
of every step. Twice they had turned to
avoid mine-props. They had gone back into
the mine perhaps a hundred feet. Now, with
not a spark of light shining out of the gloom,
they had paused and his companion had uttered
those three words:</p>
<p>&#8220;He is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was the man they had come to seek really
dead? If he was, who had killed him? How
did Pant know he was dead? Surely in that
Egyptian midnight no man could see.</p>
<p>As Johnny threw an involuntary glance to
the spot where Pant&#8217;s face should be, he gasped.
Had he caught a yellow glow from one eye of
the man? He could not be sure about it, for at
that instant the electric torch flashed on again
as suddenly as it had gone out.</p>
<p>Johnny&#8217;s eyes followed the yellow circle of
light. Then with a low exclamation he sprang
forward. There, not ten feet before them, lay
the form of Frank Langlois. To all appearances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
he was dead. Again through Johnny&#8217;s
mind there flashed the telegraphic questions:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who killed him? How did Pant know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thrusting the torch into Johnny&#8217;s hand, his
companion leaped forward and, with a cat-like
motion, dropped down beside the prostrate form.
Tearing away at jacket and shirt, he bared the
breast and placed his ear close down upon the
cold flesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead all right,&#8221; he sighed at last. &#8220;Wonder
what killed him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He still crouched there, as a cat crouches beside
its kill. As if he searched for the answer
to his last question, his eyes roved about the
floor.</p>
<p>This moment of silence gave Johnny time to
study Pant, to recall what he really knew about
him.</p>
<p>He was a strange chap, this Pant. He never
bunked with the other laborers of the outfit, but
had a private little pup-tent affair that he had
made of long-haired deer skin and canvas. In
this he slept. He was slight of build but wiry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Possessed of a peculiar supple strength and agility,
he easily surpassed other men of greater
weight in everything he undertook, both of labor
and sport. One queer thing about him was
that he always wore a pair of glasses with
smoked lenses of such large proportions that
they hid his eyes completely; he was never without
them. One more thing, he always wore the
Eskimo cut of garments; in cold weather, deer
skin; in warm weather and at work, blue drill;
but always that middy-styled cloak with the hood
attached. And the hood was never off his head,
at least not in waking hours. He had dressed
that way even in Seattle, where Johnny had
signed him up to join his outfit on this perilously
uncertain search for gold in the Seven
Mines which were supposed to exist in Arctic
Siberia, at the mouth of the Anadir River across
from Alaska.</p>
<p>And yet, with all this strange dress, the man
was not an Eskimo. Johnny knew that from
the looks of him and from his talk. Indeed, in
a burst of frankness, the man had once told him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
that when very young he had been picked up in
New York by some orphan asylum and sent west
to be raised by a rancher; that he had soon run
away from his foster home and had, since that
time, lived by his wits, sometimes in western
cities, sometimes in the wilds of the Rocky
Mountains. He had made three trips to foreign
countries and yet, as nearly as he himself
could calculate, he was not now more than nineteen,
a mere boy, but certainly a most mysterious
one.</p>
<p>Johnny&#8217;s mind took up the problems of the
new enterprise upon which he was entering.
How would this tragedy affect his work and,
most of all, the minds of his men?</p>
<p>Johnny, as you will remember from reading
&#8220;Triple Spies,&#8221; the first book of his thrilling
adventures, had been in this vast, silent, and
mysterious land of snow before. He had traveled
over three thousand miles of it and had
experienced many a strange adventure. Not
least of these was the rediscovery of the Seven
Mines of Siberia. These mines had first been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
discovered by an American prospector who, having
crossed Bering Strait one summer with
natives in their skin boats, had explored the
Arctic Siberian rivers. He believed that there
was an abundance of the precious yellow metal
on the Kamchatkan Peninsula, just as there was
in its twin peninsula, Alaska. In this he had
not been disappointed. But when it came to
mining this gold, many problems arose. Chief
among these was the fact that the land belonged
to the Russian Czar, from whom a concession
must be secured.</p>
<p>He had, at last, sold his secret to the Big Five
of Chicago, five of the world&#8217;s richest men.
These men had secured the needed concession
and had shipped large quantities of mining machinery
and coal to the mouth of the river when
the Czar&#8217;s government suddenly went to smash.
Everything was dropped for the time being and
there matters stood when Johnny had come upon
the mines. Some of them were well opened up
for operation, but the machinery lay rusting in
the sheds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>When he had made his way back to Chicago,
about six months previous to the opening of our
story, he had had serious matters to attend to,
matters which were vital to the very foundations
of his Government. After these had been settled
and the Big Five, having learned that
Hanada, Johnny&#8217;s Japanese friend and school
mate, who had made the entire Siberian journey
with him and had previously worked in the
Seven Mines, had been killed by a mysterious
shot, fired from the depths of Chicago River,
they turned to Johnny, as the one who could
best aid them in solving the knotty problem of
working the Seven Mines.</p>
<p>Johnny, with his long experience as a soldier
in eastern Russia, was able to tell them frankly
that there would be practically no chance of obtaining
a concession of any value from the uncertain
government that existed in that region.</p>
<p>They had called in their lawyers, who advised
that they proceed to work the mines on
the old concession, given them by the Czar.
&#8220;The concession,&#8221; they explained, &#8220;does not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
expire until January, 1925. That being the case,
it still holds good, even though the government
has changed hands, just as a lease to bore for oil
on a certain farm would hold good even though
the farm changed hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the rich representatives of the Big
Five had smiled, &#8220;but there is a royalty of 25
per cent which was to have been paid to the
Czar. Now it should go to the people. But
how? To whom should this now be paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this juncture, Johnny had one of his occasional
inspirations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave that to me,&#8221; he had exclaimed.
&#8220;Make me foreman of the enterprise and every
ounce and penny&#8217;s worth of that royalty will go
to relieve the sufferings of those freezing, starving,
and naked refugees I saw pouring into
Vladivostok from the interior by tens of thousands.
You appoint one person and send that
person over to assist the Red Cross in distributing
the benefits and I will get the gold down
to them, never fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; one of the rich men had exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And, just to show you we&#8217;re with you, we&#8217;ll
make it 35 per cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Johnny remembered all of that. He
remembered too how he had picked his miners,
and his crew for the big gasoline schooner which
was to bring them to the scene of their labors,
and his two air men who were to man their
emergency transportation&mdash;an airplane. He
remembered with what high hopes he had landed
on those bleak shores and had taken up the task
of making his men comfortable for the long winter.
Only yesterday the housing work had been
completed, and to-day, while the other laborers
were going over the rusted machinery, he had
sent his best man, Langlois, into the most promising
looking mine to discover the conditions
there. The man had not returned. After four
hours of waiting, he had called to Pant, and
together they had entered the mine. They had
found that death had already broken through
their guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him lie as he is,&#8221; Johnny said to his
companion. &#8220;We will bring in the doctor and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
two other men. This is a land without law.
There will be no coroner&#8217;s inquest. That is all
the more reason why we must be careful to avoid
all appearance of foul play. When men are &#8216;on
their own&#8217; everything must be done in the open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before turning toward the mouth of the mine,
he cast one sweeping glance about the place.
Beyond the body there was a pool of water. It
was evident that a warm spring must enter the
place near this shallow pool, for the walls on all
sides were white with frost. In the middle of
this pool, driven into the earth was a pick. It
was rusty and its handle was slimy with dampness.
Close to the end of the handle were the
marks of a man&#8217;s fingers where his firm grip had
ground off particles of the black rot. It seemed
evident that the pick had lain on the floor of the
mine, that Langlois had taken it up and driven
it into the earth which had been softened by the
water. Then death must have come, for he lay
not three feet from the handle of the pick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead,&#8221; Johnny whispered to himself as he
turned away, &#8220;but how?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Half way to the entrance, Johnny paused, put
his hand on his companion&#8217;s arm, then stood in
the attitude of listening. He seemed to feel
rather than hear an almost undetectable shudder
that set the air about them and the rock beneath
their feet to vibrating.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; whispered Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said his companion, and there
was a noticeable tremor in his voice.</p>
<p>They were destined to feel that earth-tremble
many times before they solved the mystery of
the mine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>&#8220;FIFTEEN MEN ON THE DEAD MAN&#8217;S CHEST&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The two men who, with the young doctor,
accompanied Johnny and Pant back to the mine
were old friends of other days, David Tower
and Jarvis, one-time skipper and engineer of the
submarine in that remarkable race beneath the
ice and through the air told about in our second
book, &#8220;Lost in the Air.&#8221; Like all worthy seamen,
they had found that money &#8220;burned holes
in their pockets,&#8221; and before six months had
passed their share of the prize money had
dwindled to such a meager sum that the fitting
out of a private expedition to go north in search
of the fabled City of Gold, the gleam of whose
domes they had glimpsed, was not to be thought
of. When, therefore, they had discovered that
men were being signed for a trip to Arctic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
Russia with the well-known feather-weight
champion boxer, Johnny Thompson, at its head,
they hastened to put their names on the &#8220;dotted
line.&#8221; And here they were, two of Johnny&#8217;s
most valued men.</p>
<p>Both worked hard at the labor entrusted to
them. But ever and again, as he straightened
up to ease his cramped back, Jarvis would
whisper to Dave:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right this &#8217;ere Seven Mines, but, man,
think how rich we&#8217;ll be when we git to that City
of Gold. I &#8217;ates to think how rich we&#8217;ll be.
We&#8217;ll buy reindeer or dogs from the bloody,
bloomin&#8217; &#8217;eathen and we&#8217;ll trim our sails for the
nor&#8217;west when this hexpedition&#8217;s blowed up and
gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave had always smiled and hoped.</p>
<p>But now, there lay before them a sad task.
One of their comrades, a fine young college
fellow with all of life before him, had been
&#8220;bumped off.&#8221; It was their duty to determine,
if possible, who was responsible for this tragedy,
and, if occasion seemed to warrant, to avenge it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>With bowed heads, they stood beside the quiet
form while the young doctor went about his
examination.</p>
<p>For fully ten minutes the mine was silent as
a grave. Only the faint drip, drip, drip of water
from the warm spring and the almost inaudible
tremble-mumble of the throbbing earth disturbed
the deathlike stillness.</p>
<p>At last the doctor straightened up with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a scratch on his body,&#8221; he announced,
&#8220;not a sign of anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heart disease?&#8221; suggested Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible. I was particularly careful to see
that every man of the expedition had a good
strong heart. Low temperatures are hard on
bad hearts. Langlois was exceptionally well
equipped in this matter. Indeed, he told me that
he had climbed Mount Evans in Colorado last
summer, fourteen thousand and two hundred
feet, without a murmur from his heart. Couldn&#8217;t
be that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poison?&#8221; suggested Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a sign of that either. Of course, to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
sure of that, one must make a post-mortem
examination. Let&#8217;s get him out of this damp,
black hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were soon moving out of the dark and
forbidding interior of the mine toward the welcome
sunlight that flooded the entrance.</p>
<p>As they approached this entrance, the unreliable
flashlight flickered out for a second, and,
in that second, Johnny experienced a distinct
shock. Again, it seemed to him that he caught
the gleam of a round, yellow ball of light, such
as one sees when looking toward a cat in the
dark. When the light flashed on, Pant had
moved, but Johnny concluded that he might
easily have been standing where the ball of light
had shown.</p>
<p>As he prepared to leave the mine, Johnny
paused for a moment, trying to sense once more
that strange earth shudder. It seemed to him
that it was less distinct here than it had been
further back in the mine. But of this he could
not be sure. It might easily be that the slight
sounds and the sensations of light and air here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
dulled his sensibilities, making it harder for him
to catch the shudder.</p>
<p>The post-mortem revealed no signs of poison.
They buried Langlois the next day in the grave
that had been picked and blasted out of the
solidly frozen earth of the hillside looking over
the ice-blocked sea.</p>
<p>It was a solemn but picturesque scene that
struck Johnny&#8217;s eye as he neared the grave.
Before him stood his comrades with bowed and
uncovered heads. In the distance stretched the
unmeasured expanse of the ice-whitened sea.
Beyond, on the other side, lay the equally
unmeasured expanse of snow-whitened land.
Far in the distance stretched the endless chain
of mountains, which to-day seemed to smoke
with the snow blown a quarter mile above their
summits. In the foreground, not a hundred
yards away, was a group of perhaps fifty people.
These were Chukches, natives, very like the
Eskimos of Alaska. They had come to witness
from afar the strange scene of the &#8220;alongmeet&#8217;s&#8221;
(white man&#8217;s) burial.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>The scene filled Johnny with a strange sense
of awe. Yet, as he came nearer to the grave, he
frowned. He had thought that all his men stood
with uncovered heads. One did not. The man
who had been the first to discover the dead man,
Pant, stood with his fur hood tied tightly over
his ears.</p>
<p>Johnny was about to rebuke him, but the word
died on his lips. &#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; he whispered to
himself, &#8220;there&#8217;s trouble enough without starting
a quarrel beside an open grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jarvis, who was the oldest man of the group
and had been brought up in the Church of
England, read a Psalm and a prayer, then with
husky voice repeated:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hollow thump of frozen earth on the
rude box coffin told that the ceremony was over.</p>
<p>One by one the men moved away, leaving only
two behind to fill the grave.</p>
<p>Johnny strode off up the hill alone. He felt
a great need to think. There was to be no more
work that day. He would not be missed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>As he made his way slowly up the hill, his
dark form stood out against the white background.
Short, but square-shouldered and muscular,
he fairly radiated his years of clean, vigorous
living.</p>
<p>And Johnny Thompson was all that one might
imagine him to be. A quiet, unobtrusive fellow,
he seldom spoke except when he had something
worth saying. Since childhood he had always
been a leader among his fellows. Johnny was a
good example to others, but no prude. He had
played a fast quarter on the football team, and
had won for himself early renown and many
medals as a light weight, champion boxer. He
never sought a quarrel, but, if occasion
demanded it, Johnny went into action with a
vim and rush that few men of twice his weight
could withstand.</p>
<p>Now, however, his thoughts were far from
pugilistic. He was thinking of the immediate
past and the future. Every man in his crew
was aware of the fact that 35 per cent of
the output of these mines went to the homeless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
starving ones of the most hopelessly
wrecked nation on the face of the earth. And
though for the most part they were rough men,
they had all worked with the cheerful persistence
which only an unselfish motive can inspire.
Langlois had not been the least among these.
Now he was gone. Who would be next?</p>
<p>Every man in the crew knew the dangers they
were facing. To the south were the anti-Bolshevik
Russians, who, not understanding
Johnny&#8217;s claims and his motives, might, at any
time, launch an expedition against them. To
the southwest were the radical Bolsheviki, who,
obtaining knowledge of these rich deposits of
gold, might start a land force across country to
secure this much needed medium of exchange.
Then there were the Chukches. Wild, superstitious
tribes of spirit-worshipping people, they
might come down from the north in thousands
to wipe out this first white settlement established
on their shores.</p>
<p>Johnny&#8217;s men had known of all these perils
and yet they had freely and gladly joined the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
expedition. His heart swelled with joy and
pride at thought of the trust they had put in
him.</p>
<p>Yet here was a new and unknown peril. The
death of Langlois could not be fairly laid at the
door of either Chukches or Russians. Could
it be charged to some treacherous member of
their own group? Johnny hated to think so,
yet, how had it happened? Then, too, there
was that strange earth-tremble; what caused
that?</p>
<p>Already his men were growing superstitious
in this silent, frozen land. He had heard them
saying openly that they would not work in the
mine where Langlois died. Ah, well, there were
six other mines, some of them probably as rich.
They could be worked. But was this peril to
follow them into these? Was his whole expedition
to be thwarted in the carrying out of its
high purposes? Were the needy in great barren
Russia to continue to freeze and starve? He
hoped not.</p>
<p>As he rose to go, he saw a small dark object
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
scurry over the snow. At first he thought it a
raven. But at last, with a little circle, it
appeared to flop over and to lie still, a dark
spot on the snow.</p>
<p>Johnny approached it cautiously. As he came
close, his lips parted in an exclamation:</p>
<p>&#8220;A phonographic record!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked quickly up the hill, then to the
right and left. Not a person was in sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently from the sky,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>But at that instant he caught himself. They
had a phonograph in their outfit. This was
doubtless one of their records. But how did
it come out here?</p>
<p>As he picked it up and examined it closely,
he knew at once that it was not one of their
own, for it was a different size and had neither
number nor label on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, well,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;probably thrown
away by some native. Take it down and try
it out anyway. Might be a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that, he began making his way down the
hill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>He was nearly late to mess. Already the men
were assembled around the long table and were
helping themselves to &#8220;goldfish&#8221; and hot
biscuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; Johnny smiled, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been downtown
and brought home a new record for the
phonograph. We&#8217;ll hear it in the clubroom
after mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the name of it?&#8221; inquired Dave
Tower, all interest at once, as, indeed, they all
were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;but I bet it&#8217;s
a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mess over, they adjourned to the &#8220;clubroom,&#8221;
a large room, roughly but comfortably furnished
with homemade easy chairs, benches and
tables, and supplied with all the reading matter
in camp.</p>
<p>Many pairs of curious eyes turned to the
phonograph in the corner as Johnny, after
winding the machine, carefully placed the disk
in position, adjusted the needle, and with a
loud &#8220;A-hem!&#8221; started the machine in motion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>There followed the usual rattle and thump as
the needle cleared its way to the record.</p>
<p>Every man sat bolt upright, ears and eyes
strained, when from the woody throat came the
notes of a clear voice:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Fifteen men on the dead man&#8217;s chest,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Yo&mdash;ho&mdash;ho, and a bottle of rum.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Fifteen men and the dark and damp,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>My men &#8217;tis better to shun.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Again the machine appeared to clear its
throat.</p>
<p>A smile played over the faces of the men.
But again the voice sang:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Fifteen men on the dead man&#8217;s chest,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Yo&mdash;ho&mdash;ho, and a bottle of rum.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Fifteen men and the dark and damp,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>My men &#8217;tis better to shun.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Again came a rattle. A puzzled expression
passed over Johnny&#8217;s face. The same song was
repeated over and over till the record was
finished.</p>
<p>A hoarse laugh came from one corner. It
died half finished. No one joined in the laugh.
There was something uncanny about this record
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
which had drifted in from nowhere with its
song of pirate days and of death. Especially
did it appear so, coming at such a time as this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you make of it?&#8221; Johnny
smiled queerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a spirit message!&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis,
&#8220;I read as &#8217;ow Sir Oliver Lodge &#8217;as got messages
from &#8217;is departed ones through the medium
of a slate. &#8217;Oo&#8217;s to say spirits can&#8217;t talk on
them wax records as well. It&#8217;s a message, a
warnin&#8217; to us in this &#8217;ere day of death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smiles followed but no laughing. In a land
such as this, every man&#8217;s opinion is respected.</p>
<p>&#8220;More likely some whaler made a few private
records of his own singing and gave this
one to the natives,&#8221; suggested Dave Tower.
&#8220;They&#8217;d take it for something to eat, but, when
they tried boiling it and had no success, they&#8217;d
throw it away. That&#8217;s probably what&#8217;s happened
and here we have the record.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;if he&#8217;s a sailor,
you&#8217;ll have to admit he had a very fine voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>There the matter was dropped. But Johnny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
took it up again before he slept. He could not
help feeling that this was sent as a warning not
from the spirit world, but from some living
person. Who that person might be, he had no
sort of notion. And the message gave no clue.
He repeated it slowly to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What could you make out of that?&#8221; he
mumbled.</p>
<p>Then he turned over in his deer-skin bag and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>For the fiftieth time Johnny heard those
words ground out by the record that had rolled
down the hill to meet him. Fifty times he had
searched in vain for its meaning. For that it
was not chance that had sent it rolling to his
feet, but purpose, the mysterious purpose of an
unknown some one, he was certain.</p>
<p>If the man had something to say to him, why
did he not say it? Why veil his meaning in an
apparently senseless song? It was getting on
his nerves.</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet and began pacing the
floor. For the first time since the record came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
into his hands, he had an idea. Somewhere,
he had read part of that song, perhaps all. But
where? He could not think.</p>
<p>He came to a stand beside Dave Tower, who
was reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;part of that song,
or all of it, is printed in a book. What book is
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your memory&#8217;s poor,&#8221; grinned Dave,
&#8220;&#8216;Treasure Island,&#8217; of course&mdash;only the first
two lines, though. It&#8217;s the song the old one-legged
pirate used to sing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; smiled Johnny.</p>
<p>Turning, he left the room.</p>
<p>In a moment he had his parka down over his
head and was out in the open air. He wanted to
think.</p>
<p>The yellow light of the moon was cut here and
there by dark purple shadows of the night. Not
a breath stirred. He walked slowly up the hill,
watching the golden streamers of the northern
lights streaking across the sky. It was a perfect
night. And yet, it was to be marred all too soon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p>Johnny repeated the last two lines of the song.
So these were the words the mysterious singer
had improvised to sing with those which were
well known by every live American boy. What
could he mean? Why had he sung them?</p>
<p>Suddenly it all seemed clear to him; the man
was being watched and dared not do a thing
openly. He wished to send them a warning.
This was his only way. And the warning was
doubtless to tell them to stay away from the
death trap where Frank Langlois had perished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Johnny exclaimed, as if addressing
the person who had sent the message, &#8220;if that&#8217;s
all there is to it, we&#8217;ve already complied with
your wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and looked back down the hill. A
few hundred yards away a hole yawned in the
hard crusted snow. Twenty yards from this
was a cone of black earth twice the height of a
man. This was their pile of pay dirt. For five
days now, they had been working on the second
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
mine of the seven. The pay dirt they had
struck was not as rich as they hoped to find,
but it would repay the labor of sluicing. It was
growing richer each hour. They hoped in time
to uncover the mother-lode. This would pay for
panning and yield a rich reward.</p>
<p>It was placer mining. Beside the mine entrance
stood a steam thawer, a coal-heated
boiler such as is used for driving a sawmill or
grist-mill engine. From this a wire-wound hose
extended into the interior of the mine. The
mine was fifteen feet underground, but even
here the earth was frozen solid. Attached to
the hose was a sharp pointed iron pipe. This
pipe was perforated in hundreds of places.
When it was driven into the earth and the steam
turned on, it thawed the flinty soil and rendered
it pliable to the pick and shovel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Johnny heaved a sigh of satisfaction,
&#8220;yes, sometime, perhaps in two or three months,
we will send by reliable reindeer carriers our
first gift of gold to the orphans of Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made his way up the hill to the point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
where he had found the phonographic record,
for he was curious to know the lay of the land
above that point. He wanted to know where
this strange person had been hiding when he
set the disk rolling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strange, mighty strange,&#8221; he whispered,
as he looked up at the cliffs which towered skyward
some three hundred yards above the spot
where he stood.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he stopped short. Had he seen
a dark shadow flit from one little ridge to another?
The surface of the hill was very uneven.
He could not tell.</p>
<p>At first he was inclined to turn back. But
he had started for the rocky cliff and he was not
given to turning back. He went on.</p>
<p>As he moved forward, his thoughts were
again of that strange fellow who had made the
record on the disk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t be a native&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;No
native has a voice like that. If it&#8217;s a strange
white man, why doesn&#8217;t he join us? Perhaps&mdash;&#8221;
He stopped short in his tracks. &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
one of our own number. Perhaps it&#8217;s Pant.
He&#8217;s queer enough to do or be anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>His mind hung on that last word&mdash;anything.
Yes, he might not be a man at all. Might be a
girl. Why always that hood drawn tight?
Why the goggles? And, being a girl, she might
be more than an adventuress. Possibly she was
a radical, a Russian spy, who had joined his
crew to thwart his purposes. Who could tell?</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; he shook himself free from these
reflections. &#8220;Lot of chance of all that being true.
There&#8217;s witchery in this moonlight. And yet,
stranger things have happened. Whatever you
say, Pant&#8217;s a devil. Who else could see in the
dark?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was standing almost directly beneath the
rocky cliff. Suddenly with the quickness of
thought, a small brown figure sprang at him.
Then another and another.</p>
<p>Right at his face sprang the first one. Not
one nor two of these could be too quick for
Johnny. Like a shot his right arm curved out.
With a screaming shudder the man leaped in air
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
and went crashing down the hill. The second,
seized by his fragile squirrel-skin parka, tore
himself away. The third landed upon Johnny&#8217;s
back. Like an infuriated bucking bronco,
Johnny went over on his back, crushing the
wind out of the fellow on the hard packed
snow. But the second man, dressed now in a
garment of crimson hue, which he had worn
under his parka, was upon Johnny&#8217;s chest.
His arm was entwined in Johnny&#8217;s left in a
jujutsu hold. His hand flashed to the white
boy&#8217;s chin. With such a hold even a small
man could do much. The man pinioned beneath,
having regained his breath, added his strength
to the other in holding his adversary flat to
the snow. Johnny dug his left elbow into this
one&#8217;s face, while his right arm turned beneath
the arm of the man on his chest and reached
a position of half-nelson behind the man&#8217;s head.
He was now in a position to break this assailant&#8217;s
neck. Bones snapped as he applied the
terrific muscles of his right arm and the brown
man&#8217;s muscles relaxed. Johnny&#8217;s head and arms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
were free. With the speed of a wild-cat, he
sprang to his feet, faced about, then, with a
bounding leap, cleared the remaining assailant
and went tobogganing down the hill. He had
seen five others of the brown villains approaching.
He had had enough for this night&mdash;more
than enough.</p>
<p>The snow was hard packed; the descent for
many yards was steep, and Johnny gained a
momentum in his downward plunge that threatened
disaster. Now he careened over a low
ridge to shoot downward over a succession of
rolling terraces. Now he slid along the trough
of a bank of snow. One thought was comforting;
he was escaping from those strange
brown men. Shots had rung out. Bullets
whizzed past him, one fairly burning his cheek.
It was with a distinct sense of relief that he
at last bumped over a sheer drop of six feet to
a gentler incline where he was quite out of their
sight.</p>
<p>By digging in his heels, he brought himself
to a stop. Hardly had he done this than he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
sprang up and raced back up the hill to the last
rocky ridge over which he had glided. From
the top of this he might be able to see the men
without himself being seen.</p>
<p>As he thrust his toe into a crack and braced
his elbows, he peered up the snowy slope to the
cliffs above. All was bathed in a glorious moonlight,
but not a creature stirred. He watched
for fully five minutes with no result. When
about to drop to the snow again, he thought
he detected a movement to the left of where
he had been looking. Fixing his eyes on that
point, he watched. Yes, there it was; something
was passing out from behind a rock. A gasp
escaped his lips.</p>
<p>What appeared to be a gigantic golden coated
cat had moved stealthily out upon the snow, and
was gliding toward the upper cliffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; Johnny wiped the cold perspiration
from his brow. Still he stared.</p>
<p>The creature moved in a leisurely manner up
the hill until it disappeared around the cliffs.</p>
<p>Johnny looked to the right and down the hill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
The light of the clubroom was still burning.
He beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>It was a surprised and startled group that
looked him over as he appeared at the door,
ragged, bruised and bloody. Eagerly they
crowded about to hear his story.</p>
<p>When he had washed the blood from his face
and drawn on clean shirt and trousers, he took
a place by the open fire and told them&mdash;told
them as only Johnny could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you make of it?&#8221; He threw
back his head and laughed a frank, boyish laugh,
as he finished. &#8220;Some wild and woolly adventure,
eh? Who were those little men? And
what does it all mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Means the natives are getting superstitious
about our effect on the spirits of their dead
whales and are planning to treat us rough,&#8221;
suggested Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Natives!&#8221; exploded Jarvis, &#8220;Them ain&#8217;t
any natural &#8217;eathen. Them&#8217;s &#8217;eathen frum
further down the sea. I &#8217;ates to think what a
&#8217;ard lot they is. Dave and me&#8217;s seen a &#8217;eap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
further north than this. &#8217;E&#8217;s got spies everywhere,
this &#8217;eathen &#8217;as.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Struck me a little that way too,&#8221; smiled
Johnny. &#8220;That fellow I tore the clothes off
was wearing silk undergarments. Show me the
Chukche who wears any at all, let alone silk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if they&#8217;re around here, why don&#8217;t we
see them?&#8221; objected one of the miners.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big cat&#8217;s &#8217;ere. Johnny saw &#8217;im,&#8221; scoffed
Jarvis. &#8220;You &#8217;aven&#8217;t seen &#8217;im, &#8217;ave you? All
that&#8217;s about ain&#8217;t seen. Not by a &#8217;ouse full.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the big cat?&#8221; exclaimed Johnny.
&#8220;I thought I was seeing things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;E&#8217;s a Roosian tiger,&#8221; stated Jarvis. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
seen the likes of &#8217;im fur north of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take a day
off for hunting. Big, yellow cats and little yellow
men are not good neighbors unless they&#8217;ve
agreed in advance to behave. Move we turn in.
All in favor, go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later the clubroom was deserted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>CHUKCHE TREACHERY</h3>
</div>

<p>The proposed hunt for &#8220;big yellow cats and
little yellow men&#8221; did not come off, at least
not at the time appointed. Morning found the
tundra, the hills, everything, blotted out by a
blinding, whirling blizzard. It was such a storm
as one experiences only in the Arctic. The snow,
fine and hard as granulated sugar, was piled
high against the cabin. The door was blocked.
Exit could be had only through a window.</p>
<p>Dave Tower, in attempting to make his way
to the storeroom to secure a fresh supply of
canned milk and evaporated eggs, found himself
hopelessly lost in the blinding snow clouds.
Possessed of singular presence of mind, he
settled himself in the lee of a snow bank and
waited. In time, a pencil of yellow light came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
jabbing its way through the leaden darkness.
His companions had formed themselves in a
circle and, with flash lights blinking here and
there, sought and found him. After that, they
remained within doors until the storm had spent
its fury.</p>
<p>It was a strange world they looked upon when,
after three days, they ventured out once more.
The snow was piled in ridges. Ten, fifteen,
twenty feet high, these ridges extended down the
hillsides and along the tundra. Through one
of these, they tunneled to Mine No. 2, making an
enclosed path to the mine from the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;From now on, let her blow,&#8221; laughed Johnny
when the tunnel was finished; &#8220;our work will
go on just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the men were all back at work, Johnny
thought once more of the big yellow cat and the
little yellow men. The storm had wiped out
every trace of his struggle with the men and
every track of the cat. But the native village?
Might he not discover some trace of his assailants
there? He resolved to visit the village.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
Since his men were all employed, he would go
alone.</p>
<p>An exclamation of surprise escaped his lips
as he rounded the point from which the rows of
dome-like igloos could be seen. Where there
had been nineteen or twenty homes, there were
now sixty or seventy. What could this mean?
Could it be that the men who had attacked him
but a few days before were among these new
arrivals? At first, he was tempted to turn
back. But then there came the reflection that
Nepossok, the old chief who made this his permanent
home, was friendly to him. There
would be little chance of treachery in the broad
light of day.</p>
<p>He hurried on and walked down the snow-packed
streets of a northern nomad village.</p>
<p>Reaching the old chief&#8217;s tent, he threw back
the flaps and entered. He was soon seated on
the sleeping platform of the large igloo, with the
chief sitting solemnly before him and his half
naked children romping in one corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many Chukche,&#8221; said Johnny.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Il-a-hoite-Chukche. Too many! Too
many,&#8221; grumbled the old man.</p>
<p>Johnny waited for him to go on.</p>
<p>Twisting the string of his muckluck (skin
boot), the old man continued: &#8220;What you
think? Want&#8217;a dance and sing all a times these
Chukche. No want&#8217;a hunt. No want&#8217;a fish.
Quick come no cow-cow (no food). Quick
starve. What you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they think they can live off the
white man,&#8221; suggested Johnny.</p>
<p>The old man shot him a sharp glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&mdash;eh,&#8221; he grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Johnny firmly.
&#8220;You tell &#8217;em no can do. White man, plenty
grub now. Many white men. Many months all
a time work, no come open water. No come
grub. Long time, no grub. See! You speak
Chukche, this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&mdash;eh,&#8221; the old man grunted again. Then
as a worried expression came over his face,
&#8220;What you think? Twenty igloo mine. That
one chief mine. Many igloos not mine. No
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
can say mine. T&#8217;other chief say do. Then
do. Not do, say mine. See? What you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>From the old chief&#8217;s rather long speech,
Johnny gathered that Nepossok was chief over
only twenty of the families of the village; that
the others were under another chief; that he
could tell them to hunt and fish, to be prepared
for a food scarcity later, but that they would
do as they pleased about it.</p>
<p>Johnny left the igloo with a worried expression
on his face. If these natives had moved
to this village close beside them with the notion
that they would be able to trade for or beg the
food which he had stored in his warehouse, they
were doomed to disappointment. And having
been disappointed, doubtless they would become
dangerous.</p>
<p>This last conclusion was verified as he went
the rounds of the village peering into every
igloo. There were rifles in each one of them,
good ones too&mdash;high power hunting rifles for
big game&mdash;lever action, automatic. In every
igloo he found men stretched out asleep, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
this on a splendid day for hunting. They were
but waiting for the night, which they would
spend in wild singing, tom-tom drumming and
naked dances.</p>
<p>Johnny did not find the people he had come to
seek. In none of the igloos did he see a single
person resembling, in the least degree, the little
yellow men who had attacked him on the hill.</p>
<p>All this but confirmed his own opinion and
that of Jarvis, that somewhere in these hills
there was hiding away a company of Orientals,
spies of their government, perhaps. But where
could they be?</p>
<p>Johnny was not surprised, two days later,
when, on coming out of his storeroom, he found
a dark-faced and ugly Chukche looking in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty cow-cow,&#8221; the man grimaced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ti-ma-na&#8221; (enough), said Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanchee sack flour mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Johnny, closing and locking the
door.</p>
<p>The man departed with a sour look on his
face. He returned within an hour. With him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
was a boy. Between them they carried the most
perfectly preserved mastodon tusk Johnny had
ever seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flour?&#8221; the man said, pointing to the tusk.</p>
<p>Johnny could not resist the temptation to
barter for the tusk. He yielded. The man
carried his flour away in triumph.</p>
<p>After that, not a day passed but a half score
or more of the natives came sneaking about the
cabin, the storeroom, and the mine, begging for
food.</p>
<p>As the days wore on, as famine came poking
his skeleton form into the igloos of the improvident
natives, the condition became truly serious.</p>
<p>Johnny dispatched a messenger inland to discover
if it would be possible to obtain deer meat
from the Reindeer Chukches living there. When
he found that a few deer might be obtained, he
began trading sparingly with the coast natives.
They had little to trade, and the little he could
spare would only postpone the disaster that
seemed hanging over the camp like a cloud.
The natives would not hunt or fish and each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
day found them growing more insolent and
threatening.</p>
<p>This to the eager young miner was a great
trial. Mining operations were going on splendidly.
Mine No. 2 yielded a richer pay dirt each
day. Indications were that in a very few days
they would be mining the mother-lode from that
digging and would be storing away pure gold in
moose hide sacks, some to be sent to the men
whose wealth had made the expedition possible
and some to the orphans of Vladivostok.</p>
<p>It was at this time that the native with the
dark and frowning visage came with the announcement
that he had located some immense
tusks of extinct monsters, a short distance inland.
He begged Johnny to go with him to look
at them and assured him that if they pleased
him, they should be brought to the coast for
barter.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, come sun to-morrow, I go,&#8221; said
Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I better go along,&#8221; said Pant, when the
native had left.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go if you want to,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>
<p>Next morning, just at dawn, the three men
started on their quest for the ancient ivory.</p>
<p>The way led first up the frozen river bed,
then over low-lying hills to a stretch of tundra.
At the distant border of the tundra towered
high cliffs, flanked by snow-blown mountains.
Toward these they journeyed, tramping along
in silence.</p>
<p>As they neared the cliffs, Johnny fancied that
he saw some dark creatures moving among the
rocks. The distance was too great for him to
know whether they were human beings or
animals.</p>
<p>It was with a creeping sense of danger and a
feeling of thankfulness for Pant&#8217;s companionship,
that, after arriving at the cliffs, he found
himself being led into a dark cave in a hill of
limestone rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;U bogak ivory&#8221; (look, here is ivory). The
native whispered the words as if afraid the
extinct monsters would waken from the dead
and demand their tusks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>He had lighted a single tallow candle which
gave forth a sickly, flickering light.</p>
<p>The place seemed fairly spooky. Only the pit-pats
of their footsteps wakened dull echoes
through the vaulted cavern. Johnny could not
help feeling that there were more than three men
in this cave. In vain he strained his eyes to
catch a glimpse of the walls to right and left of
him.</p>
<p>They had gone perhaps seventy-five paces into
the darkness when there came a sudden indistinguishable
sound. Johnny thought it like the
dropping of a small rock, followed by a half
suppressed exclamation. A chill crept up his
spine.</p>
<p>They moved on a few paces. Again came a
sound. This time it was like two steps taken in
the dark. At the same instant, fingers gripped
his arm. He sprang into an attitude of defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; came a whisper in his ear. &#8220;Place&#8217;s
full of natives.&#8221; It was Pant. &#8220;When I knock
the candle to the floor, you drop flat and crawl
for the door.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>For a second Johnny stared in the dark at the
place where Pant&#8217;s face should be. He caught
again the puzzling gleam of yellow light.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he breathed.</p>
<p>Ten seconds later, as the candle executed a
spiral curve toward the floor and flickered out,
Johnny dropped flat and began to crawl.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE BIG CAT</h3>
</div>

<p>Hardly had Johnny and Pant disappeared
over the hill that morning in their quest for the
supposed old ivory of rare value, when things
began to happen in the neighborhood of the
camp. Dave Tower and Jarvis had been
detailed to inspect Mine No. 3, with a view
to opening it as soon as the mother-lode had
been reached in No. 2. Armed with pick
and shovel, they had crossed the first low ridge,
which made a short cut across the bend of the
river, when Jarvis suddenly whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist! Down! The cat!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave dropped to his knees, eyes popping at
the sight just before him. Not twenty yards
from them was a huge tiger. With head up,
tail lashing, he seemed contemplating a leap
which might bring him over a third of the distance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
between them. Two more leaps, and then
what? Dave&#8217;s hair prickled at the roots; a chill
ran down his spine; cold perspiration stood out
on his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only we had a gun,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep yer eye on &#8217;im,&#8221; the Englishman whispered.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t flinch nor turn a &#8217;air. &#8217;E&#8217;s a bad
un.&#8221;</p>
<p>For fully three minutes&mdash;it seemed hours to
Dave&mdash;the great cat lay spread flat to the snow.
Then a nervous twitch of his paws told that he
was disturbed. Dave&#8217;s hands grasped the pick-handle
until it seemed they would crush it to
splinters.</p>
<p>But what was this? The creature turned his
head and looked to the right.</p>
<p>In another second they saw what the tiger
saw. A clumsy, ponderous polar bear, making
her way inland to some rocky cavern for a sleep,
had blundered upon them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ship ahoy!&#8221; breathed Jarvis. &#8220;Twelve
feet long, if she&#8217;s an inch, and a bob for a tail
at that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; whispered Dave. &#8220;She has her cub
with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the cat sees &#8217;er. &#8217;Oly mackerel, wot a
scrap.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Johnny Thompson dropped on hands
and knees in the cavern after the Eskimo&#8217;s
candle had flickered out, he felt his arm seized
by the twitching fingers of Pant, and, half by
his own effort, half by the insistent drag of his
companion, who seemed to be quite at home in
this dungeon-like darkness, he made his way
rapidly toward the door.</p>
<p>Complete darkness appeared to have demoralized
the forces of evil that had been arrayed
against them. Soft-padded footsteps could be
heard here and there, but these persons seemed
to be hurrying like frightened bats to a place of
hiding. Twice they were stumbled upon by
some one fleeing.</p>
<p>Johnny&#8217;s mind worked rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pant,&#8221; he breathed, &#8220;if they strike a light
and hold it, we&#8217;re lost!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Got your automatic?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take time to get hold of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot at the first flash of light. That&#8217;ll fix
&#8217;em. They&#8217;re cowards. All natives are.&#8221; Pant
jerked out the sentences as he crawled rapidly.</p>
<p>They were none too soon. In another
moment a match flared. Seemingly in the same
instant, so quick was Johnny&#8217;s movement, a
blinding flash leaped from the floor and a deafening
roar tore the tomb-like silence.</p>
<p>Johnny had fired at the ceiling, but this was
quite enough. The light flared out. There was
no more lighting of matches.</p>
<p>Creeping stealthily forward, avoiding the
overturning of the smallest stone or bit of shale
which might betray their position, they soon
neared the entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gotta make a run for it,&#8221; breathed Pant.
&#8220;Automatic ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em three rounds, then beat it. Make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
a dash to the right the instant you&#8217;re outside.
Ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny felt the hand on his arm tremble for
an instant, then grip hard.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When the great, white bear and her cub came
upon the scene on that snow-domed hill where
Jarvis and Dave cowered before the tiger, the
point of interest for the tiger was at once shifted
to the fat and rollicking cub. Here was a juicy
feast. And to the great cat, inexperienced as he
must have been in the ways of the creatures of
the very far north into which he had wandered,
the cumbersome mother seemed a rather insignificant
barrier to keep him from his feast. One
spring, a set of those vicious yellow teeth, a
dash away, with the ponderous mother following
at a snail&#8217;s pace&mdash;that seemed easy. He carefully
estimated the short distance between them.</p>
<p>But if these were the sensations that registered
themselves on the brain cells of this tawny
creature, he had reckoned wrong.</p>
<p>He had made just two springs when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
mother bear right about faced and, nosing her
cub to a position behind her, stood at bay.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the tiger paused. Lashing his
tail and crouching for a spring, he uttered a low
growl of defiance.</p>
<p>The bear&#8217;s answer to this was a strange sound
like the hissing of a goose. She held her ground.</p>
<p>Then, seeing that the cat did not spring again,
she wheeled about and began pushing the cub
slowly before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will &#8217;e get &#8217;im?&#8221; whispered Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Dave. &#8220;If I had a
rifle, he wouldn&#8217;t. Whew! What a robe that
yellow pelt would make! Just prime, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lashing his tail more furiously than before,
the tiger sprang. Now he was within thirty feet
of the bear, now twenty, now ten. It seemed
that the next spring would bring him to his goal.</p>
<p>But here he paused. The mother was between
him and his dinner. He circled. The bear
circled clumsily. The cub was always behind
her. The tiger stood still. The bear moved
slowly backward, still pushing her cub. Again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
the tiger sprang. This time he was but eight
feet distant. He growled. The bear hissed.
The crisis had come.</p>
<p>With a sudden whirl to one side, the cat
sprang with claws drawn and paws extended. It
was clear that he had hoped to outflank the bear.
In this he failed. A great forepaw of the bear
swung over the tiger&#8217;s head, making the air sing.</p>
<p>She nipped at the yellow fur with her ivory
teeth. Here, too, she was too late; the tiger had
leaped away.</p>
<p>The tiger turned. There were flecks of white
at the corners of his mouth. His tail whipped
furiously. With a wild snarl, he threw himself
at the mother bear&#8217;s throat. It was a desperate
chance, but for a second it seemed that those
terrible fangs would find their place; and, once
they were set there, once the knife-like claws
tore at the vitals of the bear, all would be over.
Then he would have a feast of good young bear.</p>
<p>At the very instant when all this seemed accomplished,
when Jarvis breathed hoarsely,
&#8220;Ah!&#8221; and Dave panted, &#8220;Oh!&#8221;, there came a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
sound as of a five-hundred-pound pile-driver
descending upon a bale of hay.</p>
<p>Like a giant plaything seized by a cyclone, the
tiger whirled to the right twelve feet away, then
rolled limply over and over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ee! She packs a wallop!&#8221; breathed Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he dead?&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>The bear moved close to the limp form of her
enemy and sniffed the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like she got &#8217;im,&#8221; grinned Jarvis,
straightening his cramped limbs.</p>
<p>For the first time the mother bear seemed to
realize their presence, and, apparently scenting
more danger, she began again pushing her cub
before her, disappearing at last over the next
low hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for &#8217;er!&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis.</p>
<p>For some time they sat there on the crusted
snow unable to believe that the tiger was dead,
and unwilling to trust themselves too close to his
keen claws and murderous fangs. Finally, Dave
rose stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look,&#8221; he muttered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure &#8217;e&#8217;s done for?&#8221;</p>
<p>As they bent over the stiffening form of the
great yellow cat, Jarvis gave the head a turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broke!&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;&#8217;is neck is broke
short off! I say she packed a wallop!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the skin&#8217;s ours!&#8221; exclaimed Dave joyously.
&#8220;What a beauty! We&#8217;ll skin him before
he freezes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suiting his action to his words, he began the
task. He had worked in silence for some time
when he suddenly stood up with a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My knife struck metal&mdash;a chain about his
neck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s pet!&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis, &#8220;and a
bloomin&#8217; fine one!&#8221; He bent over to examine
the chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;But whose?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ere&#8217;s the tag. Take a look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks oriental. Some numbers and letters.
I can&#8217;t read them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; grinned Jarvis. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t I been tellin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
y&#8217;? It&#8217;s the bloody bloomin&#8217; &#8217;eathen from the
islands down the sea-coast. They&#8217;re &#8216;angin&#8217;
about &#8217;ere. They&#8217;ll be lettin&#8217; out a &#8217;ole menagerie
against us some fine day&mdash;elephants, lions,
mebby a hyena or two, and who knows what?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood and stared at Dave; Dave stared
back at him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>As Johnny Thompson prepared for the dash
out of the cave, where he and Pant were to have
been trapped, he realized that it was a desperate
move. Pant had seen only lances and harpoons.
There were doubtless rifles in the natives&#8217; hands
as well. He knew very well their intentions: they
feared him as a leader and, hoping to trap him
here, had planned to end his life. One by one,
they would pick off his men. At last there would
be a rush and the remaining few would be killed.
Then the supplies would be theirs. In this land
without law, they had nothing to fear but the
failure of their plans. If he could escape this
one time, he would be on his guard; he would
protect himself and his men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;mon,&#8221; Pant cried. &#8220;Three shots; then
for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three times the automatic shook the walls of
the cavern. Then they were away, out in the
open breaking for cover among the boulders that
lined the cliff.</p>
<p>Now they were dodging from rock to rock;
now, for a second, Johnny saw the natives
swarming from the cave like bees; now, they
were hidden from sight; and now, he paused
for an instant to send a bullet over the head of
a runner who ran too well.</p>
<p>Soon they had lost themselves among the hills.
Only once, in the five-mile run home, did a native
appear on a hilltop. He beckoned, then disappeared.</p>
<p>After a time, when near camp, they slowed
down to a walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty close,&#8221; smiled Johnny, slipping his
gun into his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; murmured Pant, &#8220;do you think they
were the same ones that attacked you back here
on the hill a few nights ago?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No. Their work&#8217;s too crude. These others
were real chaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night, after darkness had fallen over the
hills, Johnny went into Mine No. 1 with a flashlight
alone. Having reached a point where
Langlois had been found dead, he sat down on a
frozen ledge and stared at the rust-reddened
pick-handle, which seemed to point an accusing
finger at him for bringing that fine fellow here
to meet his death. What had killed him? This
was as much a mystery as ever.</p>
<p>There were many mysteries about this place;
there was that earth-tremble that, to-night, was
more noticeable than ever; there were those
strange brown people who had attacked him on
this very hill; there was the tiger slain that very
day and skinned by Dave and Jarvis; there was
the oriental chain and tag about the beast&#8217;s neck.
Johnny seemed surrounded by many mysteries
and great dangers. Was it his duty to call the
deal off and desert the mines? Sometimes he
thought it was. Ice conditions were such that it
might yet be possible to get their gasoline
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
schooner into open water and go pop-popping
south to Vladivostok. But there would be those
there who waited and hoped for gold to aid them
in the battle against hunger, disease and death.
Could they go empty-handed?</p>
<p>Rumors of a new peril had drifted in that day.
A Reindeer Chukche, coming from a five days&#8217;
journey into the interior, had told of great numbers
of Russians pushing toward the coast.
These could be none other than Bolsheviki who
hoped to gather wealth of one kind or another
by a raid on the coast. If the Chukche was telling
the truth, the stay of the white men could be
prolonged by only a few days at the most.</p>
<p>At the same time, the mining crew had
reported indications that they would reach the
mother-lode in No. 2 within three days.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll chance it that long,&#8221; Johnny said, with
an air of determination, as he rose and left the
mine.</p>
<p>He was crossing a ridge of snow, when, as
once before, his eye was caught by a spinning
black object.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Another phonograph record! Another
warning!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Wonder what it will
be this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny whistled thoughtfully to himself, as
he strode forward to pick up the little black
messenger.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Johnny was listening to the second phonographic
record. In high-pitched falsetto note
the singer had repeated these words over and
over. That was all. If the other message had
seemed void of meaning, this one appeared
doubly so, for here there were no improvised
lines, only these two taken from a threadbare
religious song. What could it mean?</p>
<p>Johnny did not puzzle over this long. There
were too many other important matters to attend
to. Dangers confronted them. He did not fear
the natives for the present. But the Bolsheviki?
If they were coming this way, then here indeed
was peril enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave,&#8221; he said, after a long period of musing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
by the fire, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take the team of
gray wolf-hounds with a two-day supply of food
and go see what all this talk about Russians
means. I won&#8217;t be in danger of being followed
by natives, for I shall start long before sunrise.
I&#8217;d send the boys with the airplane, but the sight
of the machine would give us dead away. I can
probably obtain the information we need concerning
their numbers, rate of travel and so on,
and not be seen at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall leave matters in your hands. Push
the mining in No. 2 to the utmost and get the
richest of the mother-lode panned as speedily as
possible. A hundredweight of gold would mean
much. Should I fail to return, and should conditions
seem to warrant the abandoning of camp,
send the plane out to look for me. If they fail
to locate me, take no chances. Clear the ice with
the schooner as quickly as you can. I shall be
all right. I came to this place from Vladivostok
once by reindeer, and went north to Bering
Strait the same way. I can take care of
myself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Dave, a trifle anxiously.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do just as you say. Good luck, and may
you come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>They gripped hands for a second, then parted.</p>
<p>In the meantime, over in the corner, with a
discarded shirt thrust into the horn of the phonograph
as a muffler, Pant was playing that
newly-found record over and over. A puzzled
frown wrinkled his forehead above the goggles.</p>
<p>Presently he sat up straight, and, tearing the
muffler away, started the machine. His hands
trembled as he sank back in his chair, limp with
excitement. He allowed the record to grind its
way out to the very end, then he nodded his head
and murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it, &#8216;money in the rock.&#8217; <i>Money</i>,
plenty of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Johnny started out at four o&#8217;clock the
next morning, he set his dogs zig-zagging back
and forth to the land side of their cabin. He
was hunting the invisible trail of the Reindeer
Chukche who had come from the interior the day
before. When once the dog-leader had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
upon the scent of it, the team bounded straight
away over the tundra.</p>
<p>The cabin soon faded from view. First came
the frozen bed of the river, then a chain of low-lying
hills, then broad stretches of tundra again,
with, here and there, a narrow willow-lined
stream twisting in and out between snow-banks.
The steady pat-pat of his &#8220;mucklucks&#8221; (skin
boots) carried him far that day, but brought him
no sight of the reported Russians.</p>
<p>After a brief sleep, he was away again. He
had traveled for eight hours more, when, upon
skirting the edge of a long line of willows by a
river&#8217;s brink, he imagined he caught sight of a
skulking figure on the further bank. He could
not be sure of it. He pressed on, his dogs still
trailing the reindeer sled. If they had come near
the Russian camp, the trail would doubtless have
made a direct turn to right or left of it to escape
passing too closely. The Chukches avoided these
Russians as merchant ships of old avoided a
pirate bark. Contact with them meant loss of
their reindeer, perhaps death as well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>So, confident in his false security, Johnny
pushed on. But just as he was about to emerge
from the river-bed, a dozen armed ruffians of the
most vicious-looking type sprang from the
willows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</p>
<p>Resistance was useless; Johnny stopped his
team. He looked back and, to his disgust, he
saw that their camp was pitched on the other
side of that long row of willows. These shrubs
had been caught by the frost when their leaves
were yet green. The leaves had not fallen off,
and, even at this time of year, formed a perfect
screen, a fact for which Johnny was later to be
profoundly grateful.</p>
<p>In vain he attempted to play up in a friendly
fashion to the Bolsheviki. They looked upon
him as an enemy and a hostage, for, in the first
place, did they not know that American soldiers
had, for many months, guarded a section of the
Trans-Siberian Railroad against their armies?
And, in the second place, did not Johnny drive a
splendid team of gray wolf-hounds, which would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
be of great service to them in their march to the
coast? They did not understand how he came
there. They asked him all manner of foolish
questions, to which he gave quite as foolish
answers, and, when this was at an end, they
fitted a rusty pair of &#8220;bracelets&#8221; to his feet, and,
thrusting him inside a vile-smelling tent, gave
him vermin-infested blankets to sleep in and
sour brown bread to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a pretty mess!&#8221; he stormed silently
to himself. &#8220;There&#8217;s at least a hundred of
them. They must travel slowly, but even so,
four days will bring them to the coast; then,
unless the unforeseen happens, it&#8217;s the ocean for
our outfit, or perhaps worse than death. And if
anything goes wrong, it&#8217;s all my fault because I
failed to consider that this bunch would have
moved forward from where the Chukche saw
them. I only hope the boys find out in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He listened for a while with aching heart to
the wail of his dogs, who had been turned into
their snowy beds without their supper, and, at
last, from sheer exhaustion, he fell asleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>Two days later he was led toward a peculiar
square cabinet that had been set up in the snow.
Beside it was a pile of glowing embers left from
a fire of willows. The ten men who marched
beside him were not armed. Since they pressed
about him on all sides, cutting off all chance of
his escape, no weapons were needed.</p>
<p>They had not told him what they meant to do.
What the cabinet was, what the bed of coals
meant, he could not even guess. Malignant
grins gave the faces of the men a look that made
his blood run cold. He had seen such an expression
only once before, and that in the movies
when Indians grinned at the prospect of burning
an enemy at the stake.</p>
<p>He was soon inside the cabinet with one of
his guards. This cabinet was divided into two
compartments, each about four feet square. As
soon as he entered one of these, he was told to
remove all his clothing and was then handed a
large, coarse towel. At this, he heaved a sigh
of relief and even chuckled a little at his fright.
He was merely being given a bath&mdash;a Russian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
steam-bath. He had heard of such baths, and
was now thoroughly in favor of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bath is a bath,&#8221; he whispered to himself
as he twisted the towel about his hips, &#8220;and a
great luxury in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was pushed into the other compartment.
It was stinging cold out here. A second guard
appeared with a great metal can filled with the
glowing coals from the fire Johnny had seen
outside. He set this down upon a small stand,
the top of which was on a level with Johnny&#8217;s
waist, and backed out. A third man appeared
with a bucket of water and a huge gourd. Taking
a position directly in front of the door, this
guard dipped a full gourd of water and poured
it on the coals. Instantly a dense cloud of steam
rose to the ceiling. This much steam, Johnny
figured, would give one a comfortable bath. But
at that moment, with a fiendish leer on his face,
the man threw on another gourdful, then
another. The door slammed and a bar thudded
into place.</p>
<p>Immediately Johnny took in the full horror of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
his situation. He was to be steamed alive.
Already the dense, white cloud was descending.
Lower and lower it came. He crouched down to
avoid it. In another moment, it would engulf
him. No man could live in such a place.</p>
<p>His mind worked like chain-lightning. This
cabinet? How was it fastened down? How
strongly? His fingers felt for the lower edge
of it. Working them down and under, he
secured a hold. Then, with all his superb
strength, he heaved away. Something snapped,
but still the thing held firm. He heaved again.
The touch of steam on his back lent him new
power. Crack! Crack! Then the uprooted cabinet
swayed a second and then crashed into
three of the gaping spectators.</p>
<p>Johnny leaped forward. A burly fellow seized
his arms. Using an old college trick, Johnny fell
backward, taking the man with him. Then, with
his foot on the other&#8217;s stomach, he sent him
whirling into two other men, and, before they
could recover from their astonishment, Johnny
went sprinting down the side of the long row of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
willows, which had proved his downfall two days
before.</p>
<p>He was headed for home. No Russian, nor
Russian dog-team, could catch him. But he
was clad only in a towel, and there were many
miles of snow between him and his friends.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the rear, there came the ki-yi
of dogs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hounds!&#8221; he murmured in despair.
&#8220;Unhitched from the sled. They&#8217;ll catch me.
I can&#8217;t escape them.&#8221; He stared wildly to right
and left as he ran, but saw no way of escape.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>After Johnny Thompson had left camp in
search of the Bolshevik band that eventful
morning, he was no more than out of sight when
a slight figure crept from a snow-buried pup
tent to the right of the cabin and went gliding
away up the hill in the moonlight. It was Pant.
Rapidly he scaled the snow-packed hillside.
Arriving at last at the foot of the rocky cliff, he
began a minute examination of those cliffs.
Once he climbed to a dizzy height by clinging to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
the crags. It was a cat-like feat which very few
persons could perform, but he did it with consummate
ease. At another time he dropped flat
on his stomach and crept into a broad crevice
between the rocks. He was gone for a long
time, but finally appeared grimy with dirt and
empty-handed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Money in the rock,&#8217;&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;&#8216;Money in the rock for you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as if discouraged with his quest, he
turned and started down the hill.</p>
<p>He had covered half the distance when something
caught his eye. A black spot, the size of
a baseball, had bounced mysteriously past him.</p>
<p>In a twinkling, he was away in mad pursuit.
Slipping, sliding, bounding over the glistening
surface, turning a somersault to land on his feet
and race ahead, he very soon came up with the
thing where it had lodged against a protruding
flat rock.</p>
<p>His fingers grasped it eagerly. Here was a
third message from the unknown one. Perhaps
this would explain all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE MYSTERY OF MINE No. 1</h3>
</div>

<p>When Johnny Thompson saw that the wolf-hounds
were on his trail, though he was without
weapons of any kind and practically destitute
of clothing, he decided to put as great a distance
as possible between himself and the Russians,
then to turn upon the pack and sell his
life dearly, if indeed it must be sold to a murderous
pack of half wolves.</p>
<p>As he sped forward, through his mind there
ran all manner of stories told round northern
camp fires. The stories had to do with these
same Russian wolf-hounds. A man had once
picketed his dogs near him in a blizzard and,
creeping into his sleeping bag, had slept so
soundly throughout the night that he did not
realize the drifting snow was burying him. He
had awakened to struggle against the weight of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
snow but could not free himself. Months later,
when the spring thaw had come, his bones had
been found picked clean by his wolf-hounds. A
child at Nome, Alaska, playing with his father&#8217;s
team, was scratched by one of them. The smell
of blood had set them wild. They had attacked
him, and before help could arrive had torn him
in pieces. These stories flooding his memory
lent added speed to his stalwart limbs.</p>
<p>He ran three miles, four, five miles. But at
each added mile, the yelp of the hounds came
more distinctly to him. Now he could hear the
loud flap as they sucked in their lolling tongues.</p>
<p>He was becoming fatigued. Soon he must
turn and stand at bay. He looked to the right
and left of him. A cutbank presented a steep
perpendicular surface against which he might
take his stand with the knowledge that they
could not attack him from the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;But shucks!&#8221; he half sobbed. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
use? I&#8217;ll be frozen stiff before they get courage
to attack me.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the cutbank he ran, then, turning, waited.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>With rolling tongues, the dogs came hurrying
up to form themselves into a circle, seven gaunt,
gray wolf-hounds grinning at one naked boy.</p>
<p>Then Johnny, catching the humor of the situation,
not only grinned back, but laughed outright,
laughed long and loud. What he said
when he had finished was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bowsie, you old rascal, why didn&#8217;t you tell
me it was you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was his own team. Having been unhitched
at the time, they had recognized the stride of
their master and had deserted with him. It was
indeed a joyous meeting.</p>
<p>There was, however, no time to be wasted.
The bitter cold air made Johnny&#8217;s skin crinkle
like parchment. His feet, in contact with the
stinging snow, were freezing.</p>
<p>Two of the dogs still wore their seal-skin harnesses.
These Johnny tore off of them and
having broken the bindings, wound them in narrow
strips about his feet, tying them firmly
around his ankles.</p>
<p>So, with his feet protected from the cold, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
took up the fifteen miles of homeward race, the
seven dogs ki-yi-ing at his heels.</p>
<p>Five miles farther on, he came upon a cache
built by some Reindeer Chukche. In this he
found a suit of deer skin. It was old, dirty and
too small, but he crowded into it gratefully.
Then with knees exposed and arms swinging
bare to the elbows he prepared for a more leisurely
ten miles home. He was quite confident
that the lazy and stolid Russians were not following.</p>
<p>Johnny was well within sight of the friendly
hill that sheltered his cabin from the north wind,
when, with a sudden gasp, he stopped and stared.
Coming apparently out of the very heart of the
hill, an immense brown object extended itself
along the horizon and at last floated free in air.</p>
<p>To understand this strange phenomenon, we
must know what had been happening at camp,
and what Pant had been doing since finding the
mysterious black bill.</p>
<p>The ball was covered with black paper. This
much, Pant discovered at once. The rest he left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
to the seclusion of his pup tent and the light of
a candle.</p>
<p>When at last he unwrapped the paper, he
found nothing more than a film, a small, moving-picture
film. This had been developed, dried,
then rewound on a spool. The remainder of the
inner contents of the ball was nothing but blank
paper with never a scratch of writing upon it.
When Pant had examined each scrap carefully,
he held the film to the light. There were pictures
on it. As his keen eyes studied them,
his expression changed from that of puzzled
interest to intense surprise, almost of horror.</p>
<p>For a full half hour he sat there holding them
close to the light, then far away; tipping them
to one angle then another, mirroring them on
the retina of his eye until nothing could efface
them. Then, having rerolled and rewrapped
them, he hid them away among his deer skins
and turning over, fell asleep.</p>
<p>He was awake again by sunrise, and without
pausing for breakfast went directly to the
entrance of Mine No. 1. Having entered without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
a light, he made his way to the back of the
cavity. There he paused to listen. The earth
shudder seemed to fairly shake the rocks loose
about him. One pebble did rattle to the floor.
The next instant there came the clang of rocks
on metal. A light flashed. It was in Pant&#8217;s
hand. In the gleaming circle of light from his
electric torch, a brightly polished disk of metal
appeared. It was eating its way through the
frozen wall of sand and rock. One second the
light flashed, the next second Pant was hurrying
from the mine as if his life depended upon it.</p>
<p>Dashing down the hill, he broke into the mess-room
where the men were assembled for hot-cakes
and coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arms! arms!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Rifles, automatics,
anything. A pick, two picks. C&#8217;mon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men, believing that he had gone mad,
stood staring in speechless astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;mon, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
yellow men, the dirty little yellow men. They&#8217;ve
got an infernal machine for cutting out the pay
dirt in blocks. They&#8217;ve looted Mine No. 1 while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
we slept. That was the earth-tremble. C&#8217;mon,
can&#8217;t you? Bring rifles! Anything. We&#8217;ll get
them yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>Catching a glimmer of his meaning, the men
dashed to the bunkroom and clubroom, to appear
a moment later armed with such weapons as
they could find.</p>
<p>Arriving at the entrance of Mine No. 1, Pant
held up a finger for silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arms ready,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;your left
hand on the shoulder of the man ahead of you.
I&#8217;ll lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a light, he entered the mine and
beckoned the men to come on. With soft and
shuffling tread they followed, like a chain gang
entering a dungeon. They took fifty paces,
then they halted. A light flashed. Instantly
every man gripped his weapon.</p>
<p>It was only Pant. What they saw before
them caused involuntary ejaculations. A hole
some eighteen inches square had been cut in the
frozen wall.</p>
<p>For a second they listened. The silence was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
so complete that the ticking of a watch sounded
like the beat of an alarm clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone,&#8221; whispered Pant. &#8220;C&#8217;mon.&#8221;</p>
<p>His light blinked out. There followed the
sound of garments rubbing against the walls.
The man behind Pant felt him one instant, the
next he was gone. He had crawled through the
hole. There was nothing to do but follow. One
by one, thrusting their rifles before them, they
crawled through this narrow door from the
mine. To what? They could not even guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis fair spooky,&#8221; whispered Jarvis to Dave.
&#8220;&#8217;Ow does &#8217;e know &#8217;ow &#8217;e should go? Can &#8217;e
see in the dark? &#8217;Ow&#8217;d &#8217;e come by the name
Pant anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Langlois give it to him,&#8221; Dave whispered
back, &#8220;the fellow that was killed here, you know.
He claimed Pant could see in the dark and began
calling him &#8216;Panther Eye.&#8217; The men cut it
down to &#8216;Panther,&#8217; then to &#8216;Pant.&#8217; That&#8217;s all
I know about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s rightly named,&#8221; growled Jarvis, as he
fumbled his way through the hole in the dark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; came the low whisper of Pant.
&#8220;As you were, hand to shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only the soft pat-pat of their footfalls on the
floor of what appeared to be a narrow runway
broke the tomb-like silence of the place. Now
and again, as they moved forward, Dave Tower
felt his shoulder brush some unseen object.
Each time he shivered and shrank back. He
expected at any moment to hear the roar of
rifles, to find himself engaged in deadly combat
with the mysterious robbers who had looted the
mine of its treasure while they worked within a
stone&#8217;s throw of it.</p>
<p>Twice they paused. A silence so deep that it
was painful ensued. No sound came. They
marched solemnly on. And now, they had struck
a steep incline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down low; down low; down low,&#8221; came
whispered back from man to man.</p>
<p>They stooped to an almost creeping posture
and began to climb. The ascent was steep as a
stair. Twice Dave lost his footing, and once
came near sending his rifle crashing to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
frozen earth. Some one behind was less fortunate.
There came the clang of steel, then
deathly silence.</p>
<p>Again they crept upward. Suddenly a ray of
light cut through the gloom. In another second,
they were in a veritable flood of light. And yet,
as they glanced rapidly to right and left, they
saw walls of rock. Above them too was a
vaulted ceiling. Only before them was light.
What could it mean?</p>
<p>In an instant they knew. Leaping toward the
opening, they expressed their surprise in
unchecked exclamations.</p>
<p>&#8220;A balloon! A balloon!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true. It seemed to them, as they
looked, that the whole side of the mountain had
burst open and allowed a giant dirigible balloon
to float out from its depth.</p>
<p>What had really happened was evident.
These robbers, having located the rich mine and
having no concession to mine it, had discovered
this natural cave and had cut a channel from it
to the place of the gold deposit. They had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
reached the point by balloon. Having deflated
it, they had stowed it away in the cave and had
blocked the entrance of the cave with snow.
The next blizzard had defaced every sign of
their presence. Doubtless there had been a
small secret entrance to the cave which none of
Johnny Thompson&#8217;s men had discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gone!&#8221; exclaimed Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I &#8217;ates to think &#8217;ow much gold they
took with &#8217;em,&#8221; mourned Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, the airplane!&#8221; shouted Pant, turning
to the two aviators. &#8220;There&#8217;s a machine gun on
it. We&#8217;ll halt them yet. I better go with you.
Some of the rest of you explore the interior
here. They may not have taken the gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave Tower snapped on his flashlight, and,
after taking one more look at the giant black
&#8220;sausage&#8221; in the sky, turned to assist the others
in the exploration of the looted mine. He had
little hope of discovering the treasure, but he did
want to see how they had accomplished the task.</p>
<p>One more question crowded its way to the
front: &#8220;How had they killed Frank Langlois?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THREE MEN DISAPPEAR</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the dirigible balloon that Johnny
Thompson saw as he rounded the point of the
hill in his wild flight from the Bolshevik band.</p>
<p>With his dogs grouped about him, he stood
and gazed at it in speechless astonishment.
Where had it come from? What was its mission?
Whither was it going? These and many
other questions sped through his mind as the
balloon rose lazily in air.</p>
<p>Scarcely a moment had passed when a sound
arrested his attention. It was the thunder of
a powerful gasoline engine. He guessed that it
was the motor of his own airplane. He had not
long to doubt, for in a second the machine came
swooping into sight. It made directly toward
the clumsy sausage. Lithe and bird-like it tore
away after the balloon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Was this a friendly visit or an attack? The
answer came in a series of noisy punctuations&mdash;the
rat-tat-tat of a machine gun.</p>
<p>This balloon then was an enemy. Dimly the
truth entered Johnny&#8217;s mind. He was beginning
to connect the balloon with the little yellow
men who had attacked him, and with the earth
shudder, but how it all fitted in he could not tell.
Who was the enemy?</p>
<p>His eyes were on the two ships of the sky.
The airplane, having circled close to the cabin
of the balloon, had fired a volley, whether
directly at it or above or below it, he could not
tell. Now the plane circled close again. But
what was this? A man was climbing to the
upper rigging of the plane. Now he was standing,
balancing himself directly on top. Johnny
recognized the slim figure of Pant. Now the
plane, with engine dead, drifted toward the
cabin of the balloon. They were almost even
with it. There came three snorts of the engine
and the plane shot beneath the cabin, then out on
the other side. But Pant? Where was he? He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
was not on the upper surface of the plane nor
climbing down on the rigging.</p>
<p>Johnny sat down dizzily. Cold perspiration
stood out on his brow. The excitement, following
hours of fatigue and near starvation, was too
much for him; his head swam; his eyes blurred.</p>
<p>But he shook himself free from these sensations
and gazed skyward. He expected to see
Pant come crashing down to earth. He did not.
There could be but one answer: he had leaped
in midair for the underrigging of the cabin of
the balloon and had caught it. What a feat!
It made Johnny&#8217;s head dizzy to think of it. He
did not doubt for one moment that Pant would
do it. But what could be his purpose? Had the
balloon broken loose? Was it drifting free, a
derelict? This he could not believe, for the
thing had seemed to travel in a definite direction.
Besides, if this was true, why the machine-gun
fire? Had they killed the only occupants?
Johnny hoped not. He hated death. Whatever
the men had done, he hoped they had not been
killed. But why had Pant taken such chances?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>Then as he looked, he saw a package drop
over the side of the cabin. It fell straight downward,
with tremendous velocity. But there came
a sudden check. It was attached to a parachute.
The parachute had opened. Its course was now
marked by a little down-rush, then a pause, then
a rush again.</p>
<p>He had been so intent on his observation of
this that he did not realize that once more an
object had fallen from the car. This time it was
a man. He also was attached to a parachute.</p>
<p>As he came into Johnny&#8217;s circle of vision, the
boy rose and waved his arms, crying with a
hoarse shout of joy:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pant! Pant! Good old Pant! He&#8217;s safe!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Dave Tower and Jarvis led the little
band of miners back through the cave, they
found, as they had expected, that a small tunnel
had been cut out of the frozen earth to form an
entrance to the mine. Before entering this tunnel,
they paused to look about them. Ranged
about the walls, piled tier on tier, were black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
cubes of sand and gravel. From these came the
glitter of yellow metal. These were cubes of
pay dirt which would yield a rich return when
the spring thaw came. Bits of cable, twisted
coils of wire, a pair of rusty pliers, told that
electricity had been employed as power for
mining.</p>
<p>A smooth spot on the cave&#8217;s floor showed
where some form of engine had been set. That
the power of the engine had been supplied by
gasoline was shown by a great pile of empty one
hundred gallon steel tanks which had been stolen
from the company&#8217;s supply in the sheds.</p>
<p>Dave picked up the pliers and rubbed the rust
from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re Orientals all right,&#8221; he mused.
&#8220;Pliers got their stamp on &#8217;em. But say!
These boys sure had some ideas about mining
placer gold. A man could take their machine
to Alaska and make a fortune. Let&#8217;s have a
look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Sure!&#8221; came from a half score of
throats.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>They hurried down the narrow tunnel to find
themselves in the mine. Here, as in the cave,
they found cubes of pay dirt piled high on every
side. At the end of it all was a low square
machine with a buzz-saw-like wheel extending
from it. The power wires, still attached to it,
had been cut some ten feet from it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s a clever one!&#8221; said Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say so,&#8221; agreed Dave.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Before Pant leaped from the balloon, after
throwing overboard the two hundredweight
sack of gold which the yellow men, in their
fright at the machine-gun fire, had deserted in
the outer cabin, he performed one other valuable
service. He threw over the heavy anchor,
which was attached to a steel cable.</p>
<p>The anchor shot like a plummet for the
ground and proceeded to hang itself securely in
a corner of rock. The progress of the balloon
was instantly halted. Still filled with terror at
the machine-gun fire, the yellow men took to
their parachutes. On landing, they made good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
their escape by losing themselves in the rocky
ledges which rose up from the sea shore. It
was useless to pursue them there.</p>
<p>By the time all this had happened, Dave and
Jarvis, with their men, had come out from the
mine and had joined Johnny, who, still prancing
about in his ridiculous costume, was rejoicing
with Pant over the sudden enriching of their
treasure-hoard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a windlass,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;We&#8217;ll bring
that giant bird to earth. There may be more
treasure aboard her.&#8221;</p>
<p>In due time the balloon-cabin touched the
snow and the men swarmed upon it.</p>
<p>They were disappointed in their hope of finding
further treasure, but they did find a solitary
man. He was a white man and was totally
unconscious from a blow on the head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, you and Jarvis stay here and see what
you can do for the chap,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;All
the rest of you come with me. We&#8217;ve got work
ahead of us and a plenty. The Bolshevik band
will be here in less than twenty-four hours.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
We&#8217;ll have to float our schooner, load the provisions
and gold and beat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned once more to Dave and Jarvis.
&#8220;If you bring him to consciousness and can
manage it, carry him to the ship. Otherwise
I&#8217;ll send two men to help you when we are
through loading.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wild hours of tireless labor followed for the
the main gang. To bring the schooner from the
bank to the water-channel, a quarter of a mile
over the ice, was no mean task. It was at last
accomplished. After that, the loading went on
rapidly.</p>
<p>Nothing had been seen of Dave and Jarvis
when the last case of provisions had been
brought aboard.</p>
<p>Johnny chose two of the men and went round
the hill to assist in bringing the injured man to
the ship. Imagine his astonishment when, on
rounding the curve, he saw that the balloon was
gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; he murmured, dazed at the suddenness
of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>A hasty examination of the surroundings
gave them no sign of the missing men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have broken loose and sailed away
with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that instant he caught the gleam of a light
on the western sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Camp fire of the Bolsheviki. We can&#8217;t wait
another moment,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;And it wouldn&#8217;t
do any good if we did. They&#8217;re gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and led his men back to the ship.</p>
<p>A half hour later the little schooner was
pop-popping her way through a narrow channel
to open water beyond. She carried, besides her
crew and provisions, a hundredweight of gold
taken in the last three days from Mine No. 2,
and twice as much taken from the robber yellow
men. Thirty-five per cent of this would do
wonders in Vladivostok. Johnny was sitting
and thinking of these things and of a wireless
message he had received but a few days before,
when he suddenly began wondering where Pant
was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he exclaimed, turning to one of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
men, &#8220;where&#8217;s Pant? Haven&#8217;t seen him since
we put out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, where was he? They searched
the ship. He was not to be found. At last
Johnny spied a note pinned to his spare parka.
It was written by Pant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Johnny,&#8221; it read, &#8220;you will pardon me,
I am sure, for leaving your service at this time.
But you won&#8217;t need me down there and Vladivostok
sounds too tame. Up here there is real
adventure.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Good-bye,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;PANT.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Johnny looked at the man beside him and the
man looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer chap,&#8221; murmured Johnny. &#8220;But a
real sport at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use to try to find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer chap,&#8221; Johnny murmured again,
&#8220;Queer eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That Pant was just short for Panther Eye,&#8221;
said the miner. &#8220;Men gave him the name. One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
of them claimed he was hunting panthers once
with a skillful surgeon. A panther tore his
right eye out. The surgeon shot the panther
and grafted an eye into Pant&#8217;s empty socket.
The fellow claimed he&#8217;d seen him with those
yellow goggles off. Said his pupil contracted in
the light like a great cat&#8217;s eye. But you can&#8217;t
believe half those men tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;I guess every
chap has a right to have a secret or two about
himself and keep them. Pant had his and kept
it. That&#8217;s about as far as we&#8217;ll ever get on that
mystery. What say we go to chow?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>STARTLING PERILS</h3>
</div>

<p>In the harbor at Vladivostok a thirty-ton gasoline
schooner threaded its way through narrow
channels left by ocean liners and gunboats
toward a deserted water-front where half-dismantled
warships of ancient Russian design lay
rotting in the sun. Straight to a rickety wharf
they made their way.</p>
<p>Hardly had they thrown a line over a swaying
post when two men sprang across the narrow
space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch your step!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Johnny Thompson who spoke. The
man with him was the young doctor of his
outfit.</p>
<p>As they cleared the dock and entered a side
street of this metropolis of eastern Russia, they
walked with a heavy tread; their step lacked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
elasticity that their youthful faces would warrant.
They were either very weary or very
heavily burdened. No burdens were visible,
though something might be concealed beneath
their greatcoats. There was, indeed, a bulkiness
about their forms from shoulder to waist,
but in this Arctic clime, coming as they had
from the north, one might easily credit this to
sweaters.</p>
<p>As they reached the shadow of a building,
Johnny stopped and fumbled in his pocket. At
the same time his gaze wandered away toward
the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder where Pant is now?&#8221; he grumbled.
&#8220;I miss the little rascal, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder what made him drop us flat that
way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say. Had a reason, though. He
always had a reason, and a good one. There
was something he wanted to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope he does it quick and gets on down
here. He&#8217;s been part of my bodyguard so long,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
I confess I don&#8217;t feel safe in a new place like
this without him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny stopped fumbling in his pocket and
drew forth three yellow slips of paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the messages. I wrote &#8217;em all down.
Mighty little good they&#8217;ll do us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He read them aloud:</p>
<div class='la'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;When can you come across?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p style=' margin-left:20em;'>(Signed) &#8220;M.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class='la'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We must produce. At once.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p style=' margin-left:20em;'>(Signed) &#8220;M.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class='la'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Am in danger. Come across.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p style=' margin-left:20em;'>(Signed) &#8220;M.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What does a fellow get out of that, anyway?&#8221;
he grumbled. &#8220;What does this fellow
&#8216;M&#8217; expect? The first one reached us after we&#8217;d
been operating two months, the second a month
later, and the third a month after that. What
does he think this land is like? Three thousand
miles! But then, I suppose the rotten Russians
did it. Made threats, likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t give any address,&#8221; commented the
doctor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not a scratch. We&#8217;d better go to the Red
Cross headquarters, wherever that is. Let&#8217;s
hunt it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again they took up their heavy, even tread
and came out from the narrow street onto a
broader one, which appeared to lead to the business
section of the city.</p>
<p>As Johnny sniffed the pungent odor of spring
in the twilight air, he was forcibly reminded of
the time consumed in that journey from the
mines to Vladivostok. He regretted the many
delays. When they occurred, he had fairly
fumed at them. He realized now that &#8220;M,&#8221;
whoever that might be, the agent sent from
Chicago to superintend the distribution of supplies
for the refugee orphans, might have been
compelled to leave Russia before this. That the
Russians, disturbed by a thousand suspicions
and fears, would not tolerate a stranger who
had no apparent purpose for being in their land,
he knew all too well. The agent could state the
purpose of his presence in the beginning and get
away with it, but when months had elapsed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
nothing had been done, what dark suspicions
might be directed against him?</p>
<p>Johnny heaved a sigh of resignation. Nothing
that had happened could have been avoided.
Time and again ice-floes clogging the waters of
those northern seas had threatened to crush
their craft, and only by long detours and many
hours of tireless pulling away from the giant
cakes had they found a passage. The journey
could have been made by reindeer in the same
length of time. As he thought of that, his heart
skipped a beat. What if the little yellow men
who had come so near making away with that
two hundredweight of gold had succeeded in
securing reindeer, and had made their way to
Vladivostok? What would they not risk to
regain possession of the gold that had been
snatched from them?</p>
<p>As he thought of this, he picked his steps
more cautiously along the slippery streets. He
cast a glance to the right and left of him. Then
he started and plucked at his companion&#8217;s
sleeve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Watch the alley to
the right!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Pant so abruptly deserted Johnny
Thompson&#8217;s service, leaving only a vaguely
worded note to tell of his going, he had, indeed,
a plan and a purpose. So daring was this purpose
that had he taken time to think it through
to its end, he might never have attempted it.
But Pant thought only of beginnings of enterprises,
leaving the conclusions to work themselves
out as best they might, effectively aided
by his own audacity.</p>
<p>His purpose can best be stated by telling what
he did.</p>
<p>When he left the schooner that night and
crossed over the shadowy shore ice, a blizzard
was rising. Already the snow-fog it raised had
turned the moon into a misty ball. Through it
the gleaming camp fires of the Bolshevik band
told they had camped for the night not five
miles from the mines.</p>
<p>The blizzard suited Pant&#8217;s purposes well. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
might keep the Russians in camp for many
hours, and would most certainly make an effective
job of a little piece of work which he
wished to have done.</p>
<p>With a watchful eye he skirted the cabin they
had left but a brief time before. A pale yellow
light shone from one of the windows. Either
the place was being looted by natives, or the
yellow men had taken refuge there. The presence
of a half-score of dogs scouting about the
outside led him to believe that it was the natives.
Where, then, were the Orientals?</p>
<p>Breathing a hope that they might not be
found in the mines or the machine sheds, he
hurried on. With a hand tight gripped on his
automatic, he made his way into Mine No. 1.
All was dark, damp and silent. The very ghost
of his dead comrade seemed to lurk there still.
Who was it that had killed Frank Langlois,
and how had it been done? Concerning these
questions, he now had a very definite solution,
but it would be long before he knew the whole
truth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Once inside the mine, he hastened to the
square entrance that had been cut there by
the strange buzz-saw-like machine of the Orientals.
The wall was thin at this place. With
a pick he widened the gap until the machine
could be crowded through, and with great difficulty
he dragged it to the entrance of the mine.
Once here his task was easier, for the machine
was on runners and slid readily over the hard-crusted
snow. With a look this way, then that,
he plunged into the rising storm. Pushing the
machine before him, he presently reached the
mouth of Mine No. 3 in which three days of
steam-thawing had brought the miners to a
low-grade pay dirt. The cavity was cut forty
feet into the side of the bank which lay over
the old bed of the river.</p>
<p>Having dragged the machine into the farthest
corner, he returned to the entrance and at
once dodged into the machine sheds. To these
sheds he made five trips. On a small dog-sled
he brought first a little gasoline engine and
electric generator, next eight square batteries,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
then some supplies of food, a tank of gasoline,
and some skin garments from the storeroom.
His last journey found the first gray streaks of
dawn breaking through the storm. He must
hasten.</p>
<p>With a long knife he began cutting square
cakes of snow and fitting them into the entrance
of the mine. Soon, save for a narrow gap well
hidden beneath a ledge of rock, the space was
effectively blocked.</p>
<p>He stretched himself, then yawned sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a poor game that two can&#8217;t play at,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;Now, if I can get this machinery
singin&#8217;, we&#8217;ll see what Mine No. 3 has
saved up for us. Unless I miss my guess, from
the way the rock lays, she&#8217;ll be a rich one.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that he crept into his sleeping-bag and
was soon lost in the land of dreams.</p>
<p>Pant&#8217;s first act, after awaking some six hours
later, was to connect four of his batteries in
series, then to connect the ends of two wires to
the poles of the series. The wires were attached
at the other end to a socket for an electric light.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>When the connections were completed he
screwed in a small bulb. The filament in the
lamp glowed red, but gave no light.</p>
<p>Two batteries were added to the series, then
two more. At this, the light shone brightly,
dispelling the gloom of the place and driving
the shadows into the deepest recesses.</p>
<p>With a smile on his lips, the boy twisted a
wire into a coil, connected it to the battery circuit,
watched it redden, then set his coffee-pot
over it.</p>
<p>He was soon enjoying a cup of hot coffee and
pilot bread.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so bad! Not even half bad!&#8221; he muttered
good-naturedly to himself. &#8220;Electricity
is great stuff. Now for the mining stunt!&#8221;</p>
<p>He listened for a moment to the howl of the
blizzard outside, then began busying himself
with the machinery at hand. Connecting the
batteries to the gasoline generator to give it a
&#8220;kick-off,&#8221; he heard the pop of the engine with
evident satisfaction. He next connected all his
batteries in series and, having connected the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
engine, ran wires from it to the motor in the
strange, mining buzz-saw. There followed a
moment of suspense, then a grunt of disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not enough voltage. Gotta get more batteries
to-night. Dangerous, too. Storm&#8217;s
going down. Bolsheviki coming in. Natives
prowling an&#8217; yellow men, don&#8217;t know about.
Gotta do it though.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that he sat down on his sleeping-bag, and,
with arms outstretched, like Jack London&#8217;s man
of the wild, he slept the uneasy sleep of one
who hunts and is hunted.</p>
<p>Night came at last and, with it, wakefulness
and action. Cutting a hole through the snow-wall,
which under the drive of the storm had
grown to a surprising thickness, he crept out
and slid down the hard bank, leaving no tracks
behind.</p>
<p>The storm had abated; the moon and stars
were out. As he dodged into the store sheds,
he fancied that he saw a shadow flit from sight
at the other end.</p>
<p>Working rapidly, he unearthed four fresh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
batteries. They were heavy affairs. A sled
improvised from a plank and a bit of wire
would aid him in bringing them up the hill.
He had just arranged this contrivance and was
about to turn toward the door, when a sudden
darkening of the patch of moonlight admitted
by the open door caused him to leap behind the
massive shape of a smelter. He peered around
the edge of it, his breath coming rapidly.</p>
<p>Through his mind sped the question: &#8220;Bolsheviki,
natives, or yellow men?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Upon freeing itself from the frozen claybank,
the sausage balloon, with Dave Tower,
Jarvis and the unconscious stranger on board,
rose rapidly.</p>
<p>In their wild consternation, Dave and Jarvis
did not realize this until the intense cold of the
upper air began to creep through the heavily-padded
walls of the cabin.</p>
<p>At this, Jarvis dropped on his stomach and
stared down through the plate-glass on the
floor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shiver my bones!&#8221; he ejaculated, &#8220;we&#8217;re a
mile &#8217;igh and goin&#8217; &#8217;igher!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this word Dave dashed for the door. He
had it half open. A blast of air so cold that it
seemed solid ice rushed its way through the
opening.</p>
<p>Immediately Jarvis threw himself against the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll y&#8217; do?&#8221; he stormed. &#8220;I &#8217;ates to
think &#8217;ow stiff you&#8217;d freeze h&#8217;out there in the
&#8217;alf of a second.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave shook with the cold and the excitement.
The stranger in the corner groaned.</p>
<p>Jarvis sprang to the gasoline motor.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can get &#8217;er started we&#8217;ll &#8217;ave some
&#8217;eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>After five minutes of fumbling about with
stiffening fingers, he straightened up with a
sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t make &#8217;ead nor tail of &#8217;er. These
bloomin&#8217; &#8217;eathen; they make such queer
riggin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave did not answer. He had discovered a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
series of sealed wet batteries lined against the
wall and, having dragged one of these loose
from its wiring, prepared to test it out with a
piece of insulated wire.</p>
<p>In a second there came a blinding flash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charged! Charged to the gunwale!&#8221; he
exulted. &#8220;Now if we can only hook them up
with the heating system of this cabin, we&#8217;re all
right. Give us a hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jarvis, catching his idea, began searching for
the connecting wires of the heating system,
while Dave connected the batteries in series.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ere they are,&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly.
&#8220;Right &#8217;ere, me lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon a life-sustaining warmth came gently
stealing over the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take hoff &#8217;alf the batteries,&#8221; suggested
Jarvis, &#8220;&#8217;alf&#8217;s a plenty. There&#8217;s no tellin&#8217; &#8217;ow
long we&#8217;ll be sailin&#8217; in this hark.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was hardly done when their attention
was attracted by the stranger. He had groaned
and turned over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that it&#8217;s warm enough,&#8221; suggested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
Dave, &#8220;we&#8217;d better try to help the poor fellow
back to consciousness. If he hasn&#8217;t suffered a
concussion of the brain, he&#8217;ll live yet, and perhaps
he can tell us things. There are plenty of
questions I&#8217;d like to ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis eagerly. &#8220;&#8217;Oo killed
Frank Langlois.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went to work over the man. Having
removed his outer garments, they unbuttoned
his shirt and began chafing his hands, arms and
chest, till they were rewarded by a sigh of
returning consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I?&#8221; the man whispered, as he
opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right,&#8221; answered Dave quickly.
&#8220;Drink this and go back to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held a cup of steaming malted milk to the
man&#8217;s lips. He drank it slowly. Then, turning
an inquiring look on Dave, he murmured,
&#8220;American?&#8221;</p>
<p>In another second he was lost in a sleeping
stupor.</p>
<p>Dave twisted himself about and gazed down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
at the panorama of purple shadows that flitted
along beneath them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patient doing well,&#8221; he murmured at last.
&#8220;Going due north by west. Forty miles an
hour, I&#8217;d say. Beautiful prospects for all of us,
Mr. Jarvis. Going right on into a land that
does not belong to anybody and where nobody
lives. Upon which hundred thousand square
miles would you prefer to land?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jarvis did not answer. He was dreaming
day dreams of other adventures he had had in
that strange no man&#8217;s land.</p>
<p>Finally he shook himself and mumbled:</p>
<p>&#8220;No &#8217;opes. No &#8217;opes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t say it was as bad as that,&#8221;
smiled Dave. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a cup of tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s,&#8221; murmured Jarvis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>PLAYING A LONE HAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Hardly had Johnny Thompson in Vladivostok
uttered his warning to the doctor than a figure
leaped out at him from a dark doorway. Not
having expected an attack from this direction,
Johnny was caught unprepared. A knife
flashed. He felt a heavy impact on his chest.
A loud snap followed by a scream from his
assailant. There came the wild patter of fleeing
footsteps, then the little drama ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt?&#8221; inquired the doctor, a deep concern
expressed in his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; Johnny smiled. &#8220;But I&#8217;m afraid
the rascal&#8217;s ripped a hole in one of my moose-hide
sacks. The gold is leaking out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang the gold!&#8221; ejaculated the doctor.
&#8220;Let it go. It&#8217;s done its part&mdash;saved your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
life. An armor of gold! I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s some
class!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Johnny, still keeping
an eye out for other assailants. &#8220;But sentiment
won&#8217;t buy biscuits and honey for starving children.
Gold will. Give us a hand at stopping
the leak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go easy,&#8221; admonished the doctor, &#8220;you&#8217;ll
give the whole thing away.&#8221;</p>
<p>They worked cautiously, revealing nothing to
a possible prying eye. When the task was completed,
Johnny stooped to pick up the hilt of the
broken blade. He turned it over and over in
his hand, regarding it curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oriental, all right,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I wonder
if those little rascals could have beaten us
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; exclaimed the doctor impatiently,
&#8220;this is no place for wondering. I&#8217;m for a safe
place inside somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few turns brought them to Red Cross
headquarters, and to one of the big surprises of
Johnny&#8217;s rather adventurous life. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
hardly crossed the threshold when his lips
framed the word:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mazie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Could he believe his eyes? Yes, there she
was, the girl chum of his boyhood days, the girl
who had played tennis and baseball with him,
who had hiked miles upon miles with him, who
swam the sweeping Ohio river with him. The
girl who, in Chicago, having tried to locate him,
had come near to losing her life in a submarine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mazie! Mazie!&#8221; he whispered. Then,
&#8220;How did you come here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By boat, of course,&#8221; smiled Mazie. &#8220;How&#8217;d
you think?&#8221; She took both his hands in hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mazie, this is a man&#8217;s place. It&#8217;s dangerous.
Besides, what&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s my business? Well, you see, I&#8217;m
your agent. I&#8217;m going to spend all that splendid
gold you&#8217;ve been digging to help the orphans.
I&#8217;m &#8216;M.&#8217; It was I who did all that frantic
wireless stuff. Did you get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; smiled Johnny, &#8220;and if I&#8217;d known it
was you I would have come on by wireless.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; he said, after a moment&#8217;s reflection,
&#8220;as Jerry the Rat would say, &#8216;Wot&#8217;s de
lay?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mazie sighed. &#8220;Honest, Johnny, have you
the gold? Because if you haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s &#8216;Home,
James,&#8217; for me. These Russians are the most
suspicious people! They&#8217;ve threatened to put
me aboard ship twenty times because I wasn&#8217;t
making good. I wasn&#8217;t feeding anybody, as I
have said I would. And, oh, Johnny!&#8221; she
gripped his arm, &#8220;the last three days I&#8217;ve been
so frightened! Every time I ventured out, day
or night, I have seen little yellow men dogging
my footsteps; not Japanese military police, but
just little yellow men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm,&#8221; grunted Johnny, &#8220;I fancy Doc and I
met one of them just now. He seemed to know
us, too. Here&#8217;s his dagger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Broken?&#8221; exclaimed Mazie. &#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny stepped to the door of the small parlor
and closed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;an armor of gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>From beneath his coat he drew a sack of gold.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mazie, we&#8217;ve got the gold&mdash;plenty of
it. Again I ask you, &#8216;Wot&#8217;s de lay?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mazie clasped her hands in glad surprise.
For fully three minutes she acted the part of a
happy child dancing around a Christmas tree,
with Johnny doing the part of Christmas tree
and delighted parent all in one.</p>
<p>At last, she came down to earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we need is food and shelter for the
poor little wretches. Oh, Johnny, I can&#8217;t tell
you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; interrupted Johnny, &#8220;I soldiered
in this God-forgotten hole for nine
months. Tell me what we can do first and
fastest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a great empty hotel down in
the street St. Jacobs. It has a wonderful dining-room,
big enough for a thousand women and
children. We can rent it for gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For gold,&#8221; said Johnny, setting a sack of
gold on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we can get rice and sweet potatoes
from China by ship, for gold.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For gold,&#8221; again echoed Johnny, banging
three heavy sacks on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, aren&#8217;t you the Midas!&#8221; exclaimed
Mazie, clapping her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Johnny,&#8221; she said presently, &#8220;there&#8217;s
one more thing. It&#8217;s hard, and I&#8217;m afraid a
bit dangerous. Rice and sweet potatoes are not
enough for starving people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They need soup. Many would die without
it. Soup means meat. We must have it. The
nearest cattle are a hundred miles away. The
Mongols have them. They are the border traders
between China and Russia, you know. They
have cattle&mdash;hundreds of them. They can be
bought for gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For gold,&#8221; smiled Johnny, patting his chest
which still bulged suspiciously. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be off for
the cattle in the morning. I&#8217;ll leave Doc here
to do what he can, and to look after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Mazie, clapping her
hands again. &#8220;The Red Cross will supply you a
band of trustworthy Russians to help drive the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
cattle here. The Mongols won&#8217;t dare bring
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;And now, what
about the supposed hospitality of the Red Cross?
I&#8217;m hungry. So is Doc.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right this way,&#8221; and Mazie hurried through
the door.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the two were enjoying
such a meal as they had not eaten for months;
not because of its bountifulness, nor richness,
but because it was prepared by a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said Johnny, as he murmured
good-night, &#8220;I am to venture into one more
unknown land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and may your patron saint protect you
as he has done in the past,&#8221; said Mazie.</p>
<p>&#8220;My patron saint is a miss,&#8221; smiled Johnny,
&#8220;and her name is Mazie. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Realizing that he was trapped, the instant
that forms blocked the door of the machine
sheds at the Seven Mines, Pant tackled the problem
of escape. If these were natives or yellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
men, they would treat him rough. If they were
Bolsheviki, he could hope for no better fate.
His only hope lay in escape. The place had no
other door and no open windows. He must
gain his freedom by strategy. Evidently, he
must play the cat-and-mouse act about the piles
of supplies and machinery.</p>
<p>As he dodged back to a position behind a large
ore crusher, he managed to catch sight of the
two men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bolsheviki!&#8221; he gasped inaudibly. &#8220;What
giants!&#8221;</p>
<p>Full-bearded giants they were, reminding him
of nothing so much as of Bluebeard in the fairy
books, or the Black Brothers in &#8220;The Lost
River.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeming to scent him, as a dog scents a rat,
they moved cautiously down the narrow passage
between piles. As yet, they had not caught sight
of him. Hope rose. Perhaps they would pass
by him. Then he could make a dash for it.
Yet, this was not entirely satisfactory. They
would follow him, would see where he had gone,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
if he escaped to the mine. Then all his plans
would go glimmering.</p>
<p>Instantly there flashed through his mind a
bolder and, if it worked, a better plan. Moving
close to the crusher, he put his hand to the great
hopper that rested on and towered above it.
This was made of iron and was fully eight feet
wide and quite as deep. His keen eye measured
the aperture at the bottom. No giant, such
as these were, could crowd through that hole.
And the hopper was heavy. Applying all his
strength to it, he felt it give ever so slightly.
It was not bolted down; it was merely balanced
there. He would be able to topple it over.
And, once over, it would be a difficult affair to
handle, especially from beneath.</p>
<p>As he waited, his heart thumped so loudly
that it seemed the Russians must hear and
charge down upon him.</p>
<p>They came on cautiously, peering this way
then that. He caught the gleam of a knife, the
dull-black shine of an automatic. It was a man
hunt, sure enough&mdash;and he was the man. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
they were five paces from him, now three, now
two. His breath came in little inaudible gasps.
His muscles knotted and unknotted.</p>
<p>And now the moment had come. The men
were even with the crusher, on the opposite side
from him. Gathering all his strength, he heaved
away at the hopper. There followed a grinding
sound, a shout of warning, then a dull thud.
The enemy were trapped.</p>
<p>Pant spun round the crusher like a top. Seizing
the wire he had arranged for his improvised
sled, he rushed toward the door, dragging the
batteries after him.</p>
<p>A glance backward came near convulsing him
with laughter. One of the Russians had succeeded
in thrusting his head through the narrow
opening at the top of the inverted hopper. Here
he stuck. To the boy, he resembled a backwoodsman
encircled by a barber&#8217;s huge apron.</p>
<p>But there was little time for mirth; business
was at hand. New problems confronted him.
Were other Bolsheviki near the shed? If so,
then all was lost.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>Poking his head out of the door, he peered
about carefully. There was not a person in
sight. The wind had risen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;it will hide my
tracks!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was soon speeding across the snow. In
another five minutes he was peering like a woodchuck
from his hole in the snowbank. His batteries
were already inside. If he had not been
observed, he had only to block his entrance and
leave the wind to plaster it over with drifting
snow.</p>
<p>As he looked his brow wrinkled. Then he
dodged back, drawing the snow-cake door after
him. The two Russians had emerged from the
shed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>For hours on end the balloon, with Dave
Tower, Jarvis and the stranger on board, now
hundreds of miles from the mines, swept over
the barren whiteness of unexplored lands. The
sun went down and the moon shone in all its
glory. The fleeting panorama below turned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
triangles great and small&mdash;triangles of pale
yellow and midnight blue. Now and again the
earth seemed to rise up toward them. By this
Dave and Jarvis knew that they were drifting
over snow-capped hills. When it receded, they
knew they were over the tundra. Sometimes
they caught the silver flash and gleam of a river
the ice of which had been kept clear of snow
by the incessant sweep of the wind.</p>
<p>As Dave crouched by the plate-glass window
staring down at that wonderful and terrible
spectacle of an unknown land, he asked himself
the question: &#8220;Was this land ever viewed by
mortal man?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer could be only a surmise. Perhaps
some struggling band of political exiles, fighting
their way through summer&#8217;s tundra swamps and
over winter&#8217;s blizzard-swept hills, had passed
this way, or lingered to die here. Who could
tell? Surely nothing was known of the mineral
wealth, the fish, the game, the timber of this
unexplored inland empire. What a field to
dream of!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>His mind was drawn from its revels by a
groan from the stranger. He was awake and
conscious. Propping himself half up on an
elbow, he stared about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I?&#8221; He sank back, an expression
of amazement and fear written on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;why&mdash;I,&#8221; the man&#8217;s consciousness
appeared to waver for a second. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m
Professor Todd from Tri-State University.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing with the Orientals?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Orientals?&#8221; The man looked puzzled.
&#8220;Orientals? Oh, you mean the natives; the
Chukches. Why, I was studying them. Getting
their language, taking pictures, getting phonographic
records, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the man&#8217;s face went white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&mdash;where are we?&#8221; he stammered
through tight-set lips. The balloon, caught in a
pocket of thin air, had caused the car to lurch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking a little trip,&#8221; said Dave reassuringly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re all right. We&#8217;ll land after a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Land? So we are on a ship? I&#8217;ve been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
sick? We&#8217;re going home. It is well. Life with
the Chukches was rotten, positively rotten&mdash;positive&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice trailing off into nothingness. He
was asleep again.</p>
<p>Dave stared at him. Here was a new mystery.
Was this man lying? Had he been in collusion
with the Orientals, and was he trying to
hide that fact; or had the rap on his head caused
a lapse of memory, which blotted out all recollections
of the affair in the case and mine?</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Dave!&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis suddenly,
&#8220;as I live it&#8217;s the City of Gold!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the east the sun was just peeping over the
horizon. But Jarvis was not looking in that
direction. He was looking west. There, catching
the sun&#8217;s first golden glow, some object had
cast it back, creating a veritable conflagration
of red and gold.</p>
<p>Dave, remembering to have viewed such a
sight in other days, and in what must have been
something of the same location, stared in silence
for a full minute before he spoke:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it is,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;there&#8217;s only one
salvation for us. We&#8217;ve got to get down out of
the clouds. The last time I saw that riot of
color it was on the shore of the ocean, or very
near it, and to drift over the Arctic Ocean in
this crazy craft is to invite death.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sprang for the door which led to the narrow
plank-way about the cabin and to the rigging
where the valve-cord must hang suspended.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>DANGLING IN MID AIR</h3>
</div>

<p>Before dawn, the morning after his interview
with Mazie, Johnny was away for the camp of
the Mongols. There was a moist freshness in
the air which told of approaching spring, yet
winter lingered.</p>
<p>It was a fair-sized cavalcade that accompanied
him; eight burly Russians on horseback and
six in a sled drawn by two stout horses. For
himself he had secured a single horse and a
rude sort of cutter. He was not alone in the
cutter. Beside him sat a small brown person.
This person was an Oriental. There could be
no mistake about that. Mazie had told him only
that here was his interpreter through whom all
his dealings with the Mongols would be done.</p>
<p>He wondered much about the interpreter. He
had met with some fine characters among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
brown people. There had been Hanada, his
school friend, and Cio-Cio-San, that wonder-girl
who had traveled with him. He had met
with some bad ones too, and that not so long
ago. His experiences at the mines had made
him, perhaps, unduly suspicious.</p>
<p>He did not like it at all when he found, after
a long day of travel and two hours of supper
and pitching camp, with half the journey yet to
go, that this little yellow person proposed to
share his skin tent for the night. At first he
was inclined to object. Yet, when he remembered
the feeling that existed between these people
and the Russians, he realized at once that he
could scarcely avoid having the interpreter for a
tent-mate.</p>
<p>Nothing was said as the two, with a candle
flickering and flaring between them, prepared to
slip into their sleeping-bags for the night.</p>
<p>When, at last, the candle was snuffed out,
Johnny found that he could not sleep. The cold
air of the long journey had pried his eyes wide
open; they would not go shut. He could think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
only of perils from small yellow people. He
was, indeed, in a position to invite treachery,
since he carried on his person many pounds of
gold. He, himself, did not know its exact
value; certainly it was thousands of dollars. He
had taken that which the doctor had carried,
and had left the doctor to do what he could for
the sufferers, and to assist Mazie in her preparations
of the great kitchens and dining-room
where thousands were to be fed.</p>
<p>For a long time, he thought of treachery, of
dark perils, reaching a bloody hand out of the
dark. But presently a new and soothing sensation
came to him. He dreamed of other days.
He was once more on the long journey north,
the one he had taken the year previous. Cio-Cio-San
was sleeping near him. They were on
a great white expanse, alone. There was no
peril; all was peace.</p>
<p>So great was the illusion that he scratched a
match and gazed at the sleeping face near him.</p>
<p>He gave a little start at the revelation it
brought. Certainly, there was a striking resemblance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
here to the face of Cio-Cio-San. Yet,
he told himself, it could not be. This person
was a man. And, besides, Cio-Cio-San was now
rich. She was in her own country living in
luxury and comfort, a lady bountiful among her
own people.</p>
<p>He told himself all this, and yet so much of
the illusion remained that he fell asleep and slept
soundly until the rattle of harness and the shout
of horsemen told him that morning was upon
them and they must be off.</p>
<p>He looked for his companion. He was gone.
When Johnny had dressed, he found the interpreter
busily assisting with the morning repast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like Cio-Cio-San,&#8221; he muttered to himself,
as he dipped his hands into icy water for
a morning splash.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>After his escape from the two Bolsheviki in
the machine shed, Pant sat by the entrance to
his mine in breathless expectancy. The two
Russians certainly had not seen him enter the
mine, but others might have done so, and, more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
than that, there was grave danger that they
would track him to his place of hiding.</p>
<p>He was not surprised when his alert ear
caught a sound from without, close at hand. He
only crowded a little further back into the corner,
that the light from the broken-in entrance,
providing it was discovered and crushed, should
not fall upon him.</p>
<p>His heart thumped loudly. His hand gripped
his automatic. He expected immediate action
from without. His hopes of reaching the
mother-lode of this mine vanished. He thought
now only of escape.</p>
<p>But action was delayed. Now and then there
came sounds as of footsteps and now a scratching
noise reached his ear. The crust of the
snow was hard. Perhaps they were attempting
to tear it away with some crude implement, a
stick or board.</p>
<p>As he listened, he heard the whine of a dog.
So this was it? One of their hounds had
tracked him down. They were probably afraid
of him and would wait for him to come out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; he whispered to himself,
&#8220;they will wait a long, long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not desert his post. To be caught in
the far end of the mine meant almost certain
torture and death.</p>
<p>As he listened, he heard the dog&#8217;s whine again
and again, and it was always accompanied by the
scratching sound. What could that mean? A
hound which has found the lair of its prey does
not whine. He bays his message, telling out to
all the world that he has cornered his prey.</p>
<p>The more the boy thought of it, the more certain
he became that this was not one of the
Russian hounds. But if not, then what dog was
it? Perhaps one of Johnny Thompson&#8217;s which
had escaped. If it were, he would be a friend.</p>
<p>Of one thing Pant became more and more
positive: there were no men with the dog. From
this conclusion he came to a decision on a definite
course of action. If the dog was alone,
whether friend or foe, he would eventually
attract attention and that would bring disaster.
The logical thing to do would be to pull out the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
snow-cake door and admit the beast. If he were
one of the Russians wolf-hounds&mdash;Pant drew
a short-bladed knife from his belt; an enemy&#8217;s
dog would be silenced with that.</p>
<p>With trembling fingers he gripped the white
door and drew it quickly away. The next
instant a furry monster leaped toward him.</p>
<p>It was a tense moment. In the flash of a second,
he could not determine the character of the
dog. His knife gleamed in his hand. To delay
was dangerous. The beast might, in a twinkle,
be at his throat.</p>
<p>He did not strike. With a supple motion he
sprang to one side as the dog shot past him.
By the time he had turned back toward the
entrance, Pant recognized him as a white man&#8217;s
dog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, howdy, old sport,&#8221; he exclaimed, as
the dog leaped upon him, ready to pull him to
pieces out of pure joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down, down, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog dropped at his feet. In another minute
the snow-door was in its place again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, old chap,&#8221; said Pant, peering at the
dog through his goggles. &#8220;You came to share
fortunes with me, did you? The little yellow
men had a tiger; I&#8217;ve got a dog. That&#8217;s better.
A tiger&#8217;d leave you; a dog never. Besides, old
top, you&#8217;ll tell me when there&#8217;s danger lurking
&#8217;round, won&#8217;t you? But tell me one thing now:
did anyone see you come in here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog beat the damp floor with his tail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if they did, it&#8217;s going to be mighty
tough for you and me, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to say
about it.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Upon opening the door to the cabin of the balloon,
after catching the gleam of the supposed
domes of the City of Gold, Dave Tower found,
to his great relief, that they had dropped to a
considerably lower level than that reached by
them many hours before. He was able to stand
exposure to this outer air.</p>
<p>He began at once to search for cords which
would allow gas to escape from the balloon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should be a valve-cord and a rip-cord somewhere,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
he muttered to himself, &#8220;but you can
never tell what these Orientals are going to do
about such things.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he gazed away toward the north, he was
sure he caught sight of dark purple patches
between the white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might just be shadows and might be pools
of salt water between the ice-floes. If we land
on the ocean, good night!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hurriedly he searched the rigging for dangling
cords. He found none. If there had been
any, they had been thrown up and tangled above
by the tossing of the balloon.</p>
<p>Dave stared dizzily upward to where the
giant sausage drifted silently on. It was a sheer
fifty feet. To reach this there was but one
means, a slender ladder of rope. Could he do it?
Could he climb to the balloon and slit it before
they reached the ocean?</p>
<p>It was their only chance. If the City of Gold
was not a complete illusion; if human beings
lived there at all, they might hope for food and
shelter. There were chemicals in the cabin for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
re-inflating the balloon. A fair wind, or the discovery
of the method of operating that Oriental
engine, might insure them a safe voyage home.
But once they were out over the ocean&mdash;his
heart went sick at the thought of it.</p>
<p>Gripping the rounds of the ladder, he began
to climb. It was a perilous task. Now with a
sinking sensation he felt the ladder apparently
drop from beneath him. The balloon had struck
a pocket of air. And now he felt himself lifted
straight up a fleeting hundred feet.</p>
<p>Holding his breath, he waited. Then, when
the motion was stable, he began to climb again.
He had covered two-thirds of the distance, was
staring up at the bulk that now seemed almost
upon his very head, when, with a little cry, he
felt his foot crash through a rotten strand. It
was a second of dreadful suspense. Madly he
grasped the rope sides of the ladder. His left
hand slipped, but his right held firm. There,
for a fraction of time that seemed an eternity,
supported by only one hand, he hung out over
thousands of feet of airy space.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>His left hand groped for the ropes which
eluded his grasp. He gripped and missed,
gripped and missed. Then he caught it and
held on. He was holding firmly now with both
hands. But how his arms ached! With his
feet he began kicking for the ladder, which,
swinging and bagging in the wind, seemed as
elusive as a cobweb. At last, when strength
was leaving him, he doubled up his knees and
struck out with both feet. They fell upon
something and stuck there. They had found
a round of the ladder. Hugging the ropes,
he panted for breath, then slowly worked himself
to a more natural position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; he breathed at last. &#8220;Huh! Gee!
That makes a fellow dizzy!&#8221;</p>
<p>He had climbed ten steps further when a cry
of joy escaped his lips:</p>
<p>&#8220;The valve-cord!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true. By his side dangled a small rope
which reached to the balloon.</p>
<p>Gripping this he gave it a quick pull and was
rewarded at once by the hiss of escaping gas.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he muttered to himself, as he prepared
for his downward climb. &#8220;Trust an
Oriental to make things hard. Suppose they
thought if they had it any closer to the car the
children might raise the dickens by playing
with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung there relaxed. They were dropping.
He could tell that plainly enough. Now
he could distinguish little lines of hills, now
catch the course of a river, now detect the rows
of brown willows that lined its banks.</p>
<p>He looked for the gleam of the City of Gold.
There was none. The sun had evidently climbed
too high for that.</p>
<p>His eyes roamed to the north. Then his lips
uttered a cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;The ocean! We can&#8217;t escape it!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE RUSSIAN DAGGER</h3>
</div>

<p>Johnny Thompson, with his interpreter by his
side, found himself in the camp of the Mongols.
It was a vast tented city, a moving city
of traders. Down its snow-trod streets drifted
yellow people of all descriptions. Men, women
and children moved past him. Some were
young, some very old. All appeared crafty and
capable of treachery.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was against these people that the Chinese
built their great wall,&#8221; said Johnny thoughtfully.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do we see his highness, the great high
chief who deals in cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>His interpreter smiled. &#8220;I have just come
from there. We may go to see him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny twisted one shoulder as if adjusting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
a heavy burden, then turned to follow the
interpreter.</p>
<p>He did not like the looks of things; he longed
to be safely back in Vladivostok with Mazie.
There were times like this when he wished he
had not taken it upon himself to play the fairy
godfather to Russia&#8217;s starving hosts. But since
he had undertaken the task, however difficult it
might prove, he must carry on.</p>
<p>He soon found himself sitting cross-legged on
a floor so deeply imbedded in soft, yielding skins
that he sank half out of sight beneath them.
Before him, also reposing in this sea of softness,
was a Mongol of unusual size, whose face
was long and solemn. He puffed incessantly at
a long-stemmed Russian pipe.</p>
<p>Forming the third corner of the triangle, was
the little interpreter.</p>
<p>The two members of the yellow race conversed
in low tones for some time. At last the
interpreter turned to Johnny:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told him that you want to buy cattle,
much cattle. He say, how much you want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
to pay? How you want to pay? How much
you want to buy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell him that I saw six of his cattle out
here just now. They are very poor. But we
will take them&mdash;maybe. Ask him how much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He say, have you got gold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say,&#8221; grinned Johnny, &#8220;that we have
got gold. We don&#8217;t need a button-hook to button
up our purse, but we&#8217;ve got gold. We pay
gold. How much?&#8221;</p>
<p>The interpreter puckered up his brow and
conveyed the message. The Mongol mumbled
an answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He say, how much you want pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him for six cattle I pay one pound gold.
All same.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew from his pocket a small leather sack,
and unlacing the strings held it open before the
Mongol.</p>
<p>The crafty eyes of the trader half closed at
sight of the glistening treasure. His greedy
fingers ran through it again and again. Then
he grunted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He say,&#8221; droned the interpreter, &#8220;how much
cattle you want to buy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe three hundred,&#8221; stated Johnny casually.</p>
<p>The interpreter started, but delivered the
message.</p>
<p>The Mongol, upon receiving this word, sprang
from the furs like a jack from his box and hot
words rushed rapidly from his lips.</p>
<p>When he had finished, the interpreter
explained that he said Johnny was jesting with
him. It was impossible that anyone would buy
three hundred head of cattle with gold in the
starving land of Russia.</p>
<p>The Mongol sank back to his place among the
furs, and the bickering was continued. For two
hours it waged, ending finally by the promise
of the Mongol that, in the morning, the cattle
should be at hand; that they would be better
than those Johnny had seen; and that Johnny&#8217;s
&#8220;beggarly&#8221; price of one pound of gold for six
cattle would be accepted.</p>
<p>Once the bargaining was over, the Mongol
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
was transformed in a second&#8217;s time into the
most charming of hosts. Johnny and his
interpreter must dine with him. Yes, indeed!
They must sleep in his tent that night. They
should talk long and of many things. It was not
often that he had the honor of playing host to
such a rich and clever guest. Indeed, it was not.
But they should not converse so long together
that Johnny and his most excellent interpreter
should be robbed of their night&#8217;s repose.</p>
<p>Several hours later, Johnny was buried to the
point of smothering beneath rugs of fur that
would bring the price of a king&#8217;s ransom. His
mind was still in a whirl. Perhaps it was the
tea, perhaps the excitement of big business, and
again, it may have been a premonition of things
to happen. Whatever it may have been, he could
not sleep.</p>
<p>His racing mind whispered to him of treachery
out of the night. It had been a wonderful
evening. They had been treated to a feast such
as he had seldom dreamed of. Surely these
Mongols could concoct from beef, rice, sweet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
potatoes and spices the most wonderful of
viands. And, as for tea, he had never tasted
real tea before. The aroma of it still haunted
his nostrils.</p>
<p>And the Mongol had told him many things.
He had traveled far, had this trader; he had seen
much. He spoke of Russia, of China, Japan
and India. He told of matters that made
Johnny&#8217;s blood run cold, of deeds done in that
border-land between great countries, each seething
with revolution and bloodshed. Not that he,
the Mongolian, had done these things, but he had
seen them accomplished. And he had traded
for the spoils, the spoils of rich Russians driven
from their own land and seeking refuge in
another. He was a trader. It was his business.
He must have profit. What should one
do? If he did not take the riches, another
would. But as for committing these deeds himself,
Confucius forbid it; he had scowled to
show his disapproval.</p>
<p>At the same time, as Johnny thought it all
through, and felt the hard lumps about him that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
were sacks of gold, he found it very difficult to
fall asleep.</p>
<p>His interpreter, lying not an arm&#8217;s length
away, breathed with the steady ease of one in
deep slumber. The Mongol had drawn a curtain
of ermine skins between them and his own
bed. Could it be that this interpreter had made
his way into the good graces of Mazie only to
turn murderer and robber at the proper time?
Johnny had only Mazie&#8217;s word that the person
could be trusted, and Mazie was but a girl, not
accustomed to the deep-seated treachery in the
oriental mind.</p>
<p>He had traveled far that day; he had talked
long and dined well; he was a healthy human
being; and sleep came at last.</p>
<p>How long he had slept, he did not know when
he was awakened by an indescribable sensation.
Had he heard something, felt something? He
could not tell. He breathed on, the steady deep
breath of a sleeper, and did not stir, but he
opened an eye a mere crack. A shadow stretched
across him. It was made by a person who stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
between him and an oriental lamp which flickered
dimly in the corner. His eye sought the
place where the interpreter lay. The skins were
too deep there and he could not tell whether he
was there or not.</p>
<p>The shadow shifted. The person was moving
into view. He could see him now. He was
short and brown of face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interpreter!&#8221; These words formed
themselves on his lips, but were not spoken.</p>
<p>The next second he knew it was not the interpreter,
for there came a stir at his side as the
interpreter sat up.</p>
<p>So there were two of them. Treachery! Well,
he should not die alone. His hand gripped the
cold steel of his automatic. He tilted it ever
so slightly. Fired from where it lay, it would
send a bullet crashing through the crouching
interpreter&#8217;s chest. He was about to pull the
trigger when something arrested his attention.</p>
<p>A blade gleamed in the hand of the interpreter.
Even in this darkness, he recognized
the weapon as one he had taken from a would-be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
murderer, a Russian Chukche. He had given it
to a very good friend, a Japanese lady&mdash;Cio-Cio-San!</p>
<p>A cold chill ran down his spine. Had he come
near killing a friend? Was this one crouching
in the act of defending him against an enemy?
Cold perspiration stood out upon his brow. He
made a tremendous effort to continue breathing
evenly. He could only take a desperate
chance and await the turn of events.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Hardly had Dave Tower discovered the
imminent peril of drifting out over the ice-packed
sea, than a ray of hope came to him.
Scattered along the mainland of this vast continent
there was, here and there, an island.
Should they be so fortunate as to drift upon
one of these, they might be saved.</p>
<p>Hurriedly climbing down from his perilous
perch, he hastened to inform Jarvis of their
position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blind my eyes!&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis. &#8220;Wot
don&#8217;t &#8217;appen to us ain&#8217;t worth &#8216;appenin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>Then Dave told him of his hope that there
might be an island ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;opes so,&#8221; said Jarvis, as he seized a glass
and rushed outside to scan the broken surface
of the sea.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the balloon was sinking
rapidly. It was only a matter of time until the
cabin would bump upon an ice-pile. Then it was
doubtful if even the quickest action could save
their lives.</p>
<p>They brought the stranger, who was now
able to sit up and stare about him, to the outer
deck. He gazed down at the swaying, flying
landscape and was badly frightened when he
discovered that they were in midair, but Dave
reassured him, while Jarvis brought sleeping-bags
and boxes of food to a position by the rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the worst &#8217;appens, we&#8217;ll at least h&#8217;eat and
sleep on the floe until it &#8217;eaps up an&#8217; buries us,&#8221;
he grumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land ahead!&#8221; exclaimed Dave suddenly,
throwing down his glasses and rushing inside
the cabin. He was out again in a moment, bearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
on his shoulder a coil of steel cable, and
dragging a heavy land anchor after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may be able to save the old boat yet,&#8221; he
yelled excitedly. &#8220;Jarvis, bring out the rope
ladder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jarvis hastened inside and reappeared almost
immediately with the ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an island,&#8221; said Dave, &#8220;and, as far as I
can judge, we&#8217;re only two or three hundred feet
from its surface when we get above it. We&#8217;ll
throw over the anchor and if it catches somewhere,
we&#8217;ll go down the ladder. In time the
balloon will lose gas enough to bring her to
earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You &#8217;ave a good &#8217;ead, me lad,&#8221; approved
Jarvis. &#8220;&#8217;Ere&#8217;s &#8216;opin&#8217; it &#8217;appens that way!&#8221;</p>
<p>It did happen that way, and, in due course of
time, the three men found themselves on the
brow of a low plateau which seemed as deserted
as the pyramids of Egypt, and quite as barren
of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing&#8217;s sure,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
to get the gas back into that old cloth tank and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
catch a fair wind, or get that engine to working,
if we don&#8217;t wish to starve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a strange pile of rocks up on the
ledge there. I&#8217;m going for a look at it,&#8221; said
Dave.</p>
<p>He returned in a few moments, mingled
excitement and amusement on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jarvis,&#8221; he smiled happily, &#8220;we&#8217;re not so
badly off, after all. Here we are right back in
old United States of America!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;United States?&#8221; Jarvis stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Says so in this message I found in a brass
can. Says&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave broke off suddenly. Something on the
crest to the right of them had caught his attention.
Grasping his automatic, Dave went skulking
away in the shadow of the hill.</p>
<p>Jarvis, too, had seen it and awaited the outcome
of this venture with eager expectancy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>CIO-CIO-SAN</h3>
</div>

<p>Hardly had Johnny Thompson&#8217;s finger lessened
its pressure on the trigger of his automatic,
than the interpreter sprang straight at
the figure that cast the shadow.</p>
<p>A scream rent the air.</p>
<p>With a spring, Johnny was on his feet, just
in time to see one of the figures drop. In the
dim light he could not tell which one. He stood
there motionless. It had all happened so quickly
that he was stunned into inactivity.</p>
<p>In that brief moment bedlam broke loose. The
Mongol chief sprang from behind his curtain.
Other Mongols, deserting all night games of
chance, came swarming in on all sides. Their
jargon was unintelligible. Johnny could not tell
them what had happened, even had he rightly
known.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>The fallen man was dragged out upon the
snow, where his blood made a rapidly spreading
dark circle on the crystal whiteness. He was
dead beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>Slowly the group settled in a dense ring about
some one who was talking rapidly. Evidently
the survivor of the tragedy was explaining. Was
it the interpreter or the other? Johnny could
not crowd close enough to tell.</p>
<p>He flashed his electric torch upon the fallen
body. The sight of the hilt protruding from the
chest, over the heart, gave Johnny a start. His
interpreter had won. It was his knife that had
made the fatal thrust. The dead man was
undoubtedly Oriental and not a member of the
Mongolian tribe.</p>
<p>That knife! Johnny started. How had this
person come into possession of that blade which
he had given to Cio-Cio-San? That Cio-Cio-San
would not give it away, he was certain. What
then had happened? Had it been stolen from
her, or was this strange interpreter, who had
doubtless just now saved his life, Cio-Cio-San
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
herself? It seemed unbelievable, yet his mind
clung to the theory. He would soon know.</p>
<p>Slowly the crowd dispersed. The killing of
an Oriental in such a camp as this was merely
an incident in the life of the tribe, a thing soon
to be forgotten. Two servants of the chief
bore the body away. Once more Johnny found
himself sitting in the triangle with his interpreter
and the Mongol. In his hands he held
two knives; one he had drawn from the heart
of the dead man and had cleansed in the snow;
the other was the one dropped by the murderer.
This last one evidently had been meant for him.</p>
<p>The Mongol was profuse in his apologies,
while he lauded to the sky the bravery of the
little interpreter. The slain man, he explained,
was no member of his company. He was one
of three who had camped on the outer edge of
the village that very night. Doubtless they had
followed Johnny with the purpose of murdering
and robbing him. He had sent at once for the
other two men, but they had fled. He hoped
now that his guests might sleep in peace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>After delivering this message, he bowed himself
back through the curtains. Johnny and the
interpreter were left alone. It was a dramatic
moment. The interpreter&#8217;s fingers twitched
nervously. Once the brown eyes fell upon the
knives Johnny held, but instantly they flashed
away. Johnny had drawn a freshly lighted
fish-oil lamp to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend,&#8221; said he in a low tone, &#8220;you have
done me a great service this night. Will you do
me but one more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly, most gracious one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The small head bent low.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allow me.&#8221; Johnny took one of the brown
hands, and began rolling up the loose sleeve of
the brown-skin parka. The brown face blanched
a trifle. He uncovered a sleeve of pink silk, and
beneath that a slender brown arm. On the arm,
a finger&#8217;s length beneath the elbow, was a triangular
scar.</p>
<p>Johnny sighed, then carefully rolling down
the sleeve, dropped the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is enough,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;you are my old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
and very dear friend, Cio-Cio-San. You have
to-night added greatly to the debt of gratitude
which I owe you and can never repay. But why
did you come? And why, most of all, are you in
disguise? Why are you in Russia at all? Why
not in your beloved Japan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cio-Cio-San sighed as if relieved at feeling
the mask removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to Russia to find a very dear relative
who had lived with my family in the interior
of Russia before this revolution came upon us.
I met Mazie; your so good friend. She pressed
me into her service. Who could refuse? I was
glad to be of help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, because there was no Japanese man
who could speak for you to the Mongols, she
asked me to go. And, because it is unsafe for
a woman to go on such a journey, undisguised,
I dressed as a man. So, there you have it all.
I am glad you know, you are a man of great
honor. You will not tell others. You will protect
me from them.&#8221; There was no question in
her voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>Johnny put out his hand in silence. Her small
brown one rested in his for a moment.</p>
<p>Then in drowsy silence they sat by the sputtering
lamp until the tinkle of bell, the clatter
of harness, the shout of drivers, and the distant
lowing of cattle, told them it was another day.</p>
<p>That day&#8217;s business was quickly brought to a
close. Before the sun was high in the heavens,
Johnny found himself once more tucked beside
his interpreter in the cutter, slowly following his
Russians, who drove a splendid herd of cattle
over the snow-clad fields and hard-packed roads
toward Vladivostok. Johnny owned that herd.
Soon it would be supplying nourishment to the
hungry little ones.</p>
<p>The return journey was crowded with recollections
of other days, of those days when he
and Cio-Cio-San had followed the glistening
trail to the far Northland. But, as the spires
of the cathedral in the city loomed up to greet
him, Johnny&#8217;s mind was filled with many wonderings
and not a few misgivings. He was coming
to the city of eastern Russia which more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
than any other had seen revolt and counter-revolt,
pillage and sudden death. In that city
now, starvation and disease stalked unmolested.
In that city, the wary Japanese military police
maintained order while many a rampant radical
lurked in a corner to slay any who did not
believe in his gospel of unlimited freedom and
license. Into that city Johnny must go. Every
man in it craved gold and food, and Johnny had
both. He would use it for the good of the sufferers,
if he was given time. But those who rob
and kill, do not wait. He was troubled about
Mazie. He had trusted gold to her care. Had
he acted unwisely; subjected her to needless
perils?</p>
<p>He thought of the Oriental who had attempted
to take his life back there in the Mongol&#8217;s
camp. There had been a strong resemblance
between this man and the band of men who had
attempted to rob Mine No. 1. Had they secured
reindeer and made their way to Vladivostok? If
so, they would dog his trail, using every foul
means to regain possession of the gold. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Mazie? If they had entered the city, had they
discovered that part of the gold was in her
hands? He shivered at the thought of it.</p>
<p>At last, leaving the cattle in a great yard,
surrounded by a stone fence, some five miles
from the outskirts, he drove hurriedly into
Vladivostok.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>NEARING THE CITY OF GOLD</h3>
</div>

<p>The creature for which Dave had gone on a
double-quick hunt, after the balloon had landed
on the desert island, was a reindeer. He had
probably crossed over on a solid floe from the
mainland. It was his last crossing. Soon Dave
came back dragging two hundred pounds of
fresh meat behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more &#8216;gold fish&#8217; in cans,&#8221; he exulted.
&#8220;No more evaporated milk and pickled egg.
We eat, Jarvis, we eat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; smiled Jarvis, &#8220;but what&#8217;s all
the words you been spillin&#8217; about this bein&#8217;
America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; laughed Dave. &#8220;That was something
of a joke, though this island really does
belong to old U.S.A. Captain DeLong, an
American, whose ship was crushed in the ice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
near this island, was its first discoverer. He
claimed it in the name of his country and christened
it Bennett Island. It says that in the message
he left in his cairn. But that don&#8217;t feed us.
I&#8217;m starved. There&#8217;s driftwood on the beach.
C&#8217;mon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon they were roasting strips of delicious
venison over a crackling fire. Supper over, they
lay down with faces to the fire and talked over
prospects for the future. The stranger was
with them, but had little to say. He seemed
puzzled at the unusual circumstances of the
journey and was constantly asking when they
would return to the native village at the mouth
of the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently,&#8221; said Dave, after a long and
fruitless attempt to draw from him any account
of his life with the Orientals in the mine, &#8220;the
rap he received on his head blotted out all memory
of those days. If we can&#8217;t get that particular
stretch of memory in working order, we
may never know how Frank Langlois was killed,
nor who it was that sent us strange messages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
on phonographic records and moving-picture
films. I&#8217;m hoping his memory&#8217;ll come back. A
sudden shock may bring it round at any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their conference regarding the future
resulted in a determination to wait for a change
of wind which would insure them a safe trip to
the mainland. In the meantime, Dave would
prepare the chemicals for immediate inflation of
the balloon and Jarvis would study over the Japanese
puzzle of a gasoline engine which would
not respond to his touch.</p>
<p>Jarvis&#8217; work netted nothing. Three days
later an onshore wind arose, and the balloon,
wafted upward on its gentle crest, brought the
explorers back to the mainland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land! Land! And the City of Gold!&#8221;
exclaimed Jarvis, as the evening clouds lifted
and gave them a momentary view of that
strange golden gleam which for so long had
haunted their dreams.</p>
<p>Once before, many months ago, the two of
them had neared the spot on an ocean craft,
but duty to marooned comrades had called them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
back. Now they had only themselves to think
of, and the City of Gold, if city it be, would
offer to them a haven of refuge.</p>
<p>What wonder that their hearts beat wildly
as they caught its gleam and realized that in
a very few moments they would be landing
within a quarter of a mile of that mysterious
city, which, according to the natives whom they
had met long ago, did really exist as a place of
many people and much gold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull the cord! Pull the cord!&#8221; shouted
Jarvis excitedly. &#8220;We&#8217;re nearin&#8217; shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had spoken the truth. As Dave gripped
the cord attached to the gas valve on the balloon
and in his imagination heard the hiss of
escaping gas and felt the drop of the balloon,
his thoughts sobered. After all, what did they
know about these strange people? What sort
of treatment would they receive from them?
If they landed they might, in less than an hour,
be dead. Might it not be better to allow the
balloon to rise and to attempt a journey back
to some Russian town? But instantly he realized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
that this gale which was coming would
carry them to the heart of Bolsheviki Russia.
What chance would they have there?</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull the cord! Pull the cord!&#8221; insisted
Jarvis.</p>
<p>Mechanically, Dave&#8217;s hand came down. The
hiss of air was followed by the sagging drop
of the car. The die had been cast.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>For an hour, after admitting the white man&#8217;s
dog to his secret mine, Pant sat listening for
any sound that might tell of his discovery.
After this, heaving a sigh of relief, he turned
at once to the work that lay before him. He
realized that whatever he did must be done soon.</p>
<p>Dragging the newly acquired batteries back
to where the others were lined up along the
wall, he attached one of them to the circuit,
then threw in the switch which should set the
buzz-saw mining machine into operation. An
angry spit and flare was his only reward.</p>
<p>Nothing daunted, he cut in another battery,
then another. As he touched the switch after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
attaching the third battery, a loud whirring
sound rewarded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eureka! I have found it!&#8221; he cried, leaping
high in air. &#8220;Now we win!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog barked loudly at this singular demonstration,
but since the vault-like mine was sound
proof, it mattered little how noisy was his
rejoicing.</p>
<p>The cutting machine was instantly set in
operation. The sing of the wheel against the
frozen earth was deafening. The earth-tremble,
started by the machinery, could not fail
to make itself felt outside the mine. But when
he realized that only the yellow men knew the
cause of such a tremble and that they were many
miles from that spot, making their way south
with dog team or reindeer, Pant had little fear.
He would find his way to the mother-lode,
would melt snow from the inside of the bank by
the mine&#8217;s entrance, would wash out the gold;
then, if only he could evade the Russians and
the Chukches, he would begin the southward
journey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>Hour by hour, the stacks of dark brown cubes
of frozen pay dirt grew at the sides of the mine.
Hour by hour, the yellow glistened more brightly
in the cubes. Yet he did not come to the mother-lode.
He slept but little, taking short snatches
now and then. Sometimes he fell asleep at his
task. One thing began to worry him; the gasoline
was running short. With no gasoline to
run his motor, there could be no electric current,
no power.</p>
<p>Now and again he fancied that men were
prowling about the snow-blocked entrance. He
knew these were only fancies. Sleepless days
and nights were telling on his nerves. When
would the rich pay come?</p>
<p>At last, while half asleep, he worked on the
upper tiers of cubes, there came a jarring rattle
which brought him up standing. The wheel had
struck solid rock. This meant that there was
a ledge, a former miniature fall in the river
bed. At the foot of this fall, there would be a
pocket, and in that pocket, much gold. The
gasoline? There was yet enough. To-morrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
he would clean up the mother-lode. Then he
would be away.</p>
<p>He stumbled, as in a dream, to his blankets,
and, wrapping them about him, fell into a
stupor that was sleep and more.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>As the balloon, in which Dave Tower and
Jarvis rode, drifted toward the shore of the
mainland, Dave, shading his eyes, watched the
yellow gleam of the City of Gold darken to a
purplish black, then back to a dull gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, it&#8217;s gone. I &#8217;ates to look,&#8221; groaned
Jarvis. &#8220;It&#8217;s gone, the City of Gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave had been expecting something like this
to happen. &#8220;Probably the surface of some
gigantic rock, polished by wind and rain, reflecting
the rays of the sun,&#8221; was his mental comment.
He did not have the heart to express
his thoughts to Jarvis.</p>
<p>They drifted on. Suddenly Dave dived into
the cabin and returned with a pair of powerful
binoculars. He turned these on the spot where
the shining City of Gold had been.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>What he saw brought an exclamation to his
lips. It died there unuttered. &#8220;After all,&#8221; he
thought to himself, &#8220;it may be nothing, just
nothing at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>What he had seen was still brownish gray in
color, but instead of the flat even surface of a
rock broken here and there by irregular fissures,
he had seen innumerable squares, placed as
regularly as the roofs of a house. &#8220;Nature
does not build that way. Man must have had
a hand in it. Here&#8217;s hoping.&#8221; Such were his
mental comments as he saw land rise up to meet
them. Were they nearing an inhabited land?</p>
<p>He did not have long to wait for the answer.
As the balloon drifted in over the land, figures
ran across the snow, in evident pursuit of the
drifting &#8220;sausage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jarvis, who had taken the glass, let out a
roar. &#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;uman&#8217;s, me lad, &#8217;uman bein&#8217;s it is,
and if it&#8217;s no one but the bloody, bloomin&#8217;
&#8217;eathen, I&#8217;ll be glad to see &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right. As the anchor, catching in a
claybank, jerked the balloon to a sudden halt,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
they could see the people racing toward the point
where the car was sure to land.</p>
<p>Dave&#8217;s mind was in a whirl. First his right
hand gripped his automatic, next it hung limp
at his side. What manner of people were they,
anyway? If that broad flat surface of little
squares meant the roof of a building, then these
certainly were not natives, Chukches or Eskimos.
Those always lived in houses of deer skin or
snow. And, if it was a house, what an immense
thing it must be. A hundred feet long, perhaps
two hundred, and half as wide.</p>
<p>There was little time for speculation. The
balloon carriage dropped rapidly. Their daft
professor hung to the rail, babbling incoherent
things about returning to the mouth of the
Anadir. Jarvis was silent. Evidently there
was but one thing to do; to trust themselves to
the tender mercies of these people.</p>
<p>As the cabin bumped the snowy tundra, Dave
sprang over the rail, followed by Jarvis, who
assisted the still feeble professor.</p>
<p>They found themselves at once in the midst of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
a curious-eyed group of people. These, with
their long beards and droll clothing and droll
manners, made Dave feel as if he were another
Rip Van Winkle entering a land of dreams.</p>
<p>In the crowd there were some twenty men,
slowly straggling in. There was a woman of
middle age, and beside her a girl of about sixteen
years, evidently her daughter. Dave&#8217;s
eyes approved of the girl, and though she
was a stranger to his tongue, she did not fail
to find an immediate means of letting him know
that she looked upon him with much favor.</p>
<p>All these people were dressed in skins, fawn
skins for the most part, though there were
occasional garments of leather. The garments
were not cut at all after the manner of Chukches
or Eskimos. The girl wore a skirt and a
loose middy-like jacket of white buckskin, the
skin of which had been split thin. The garments
suited her wonderfully well.</p>
<p>Dave had concluded, before one of them
spoke, that they were Russians. When the oldest
man of the group attempted to address him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
he knew his guess to be correct, though he
understood not one word of what was being
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what,&#8221; he asked himself, &#8220;are these
people doing here so far within the Arctic Circle,
and how do they live?&#8221;</p>
<p>Having made it evident that he did not
understand their language, he awaited further
attempts at conversation. Other languages were
tried with no success, until a man of thirty years
or past suddenly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you speak English?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave could have wept on his shoulders for
pure joy. What he did do was to extend his
hand with a hearty, &#8220;Put her there, old chap,
that&#8217;s just what I do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be hungry,&#8221; said the new-found
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could eat,&#8221; admitted Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having made sure that the balloon was in a
safe position, Dave and Jarvis, assisting the
professor, followed their host round a point of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
rock and up to a row of cabins on the southern
side of the hill. Having entered one of these,
they were invited to sit down while the professor
was helped to a room in the rear and tucked
into bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; said the stranger, &#8220;we
can offer you only venison and fresh sweet
potatoes for your main course. You will perhaps
not mind that. But in the matter of
salads, we can give you a little choice. Will you
have head lettuce or sliced cucumbers?&#8221; He
smiled genially.</p>
<p>Dave looked at Jarvis; Jarvis stared at Dave.
Was this man jesting? Head lettuce and cucumbers
in mid-winter, inside the Arctic Circle?
What a rank impossibility! Yet the man did
not smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s &#8217;ead lettuce an&#8217; a little whale blubber,&#8221;
laughed Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yours?&#8221; smiled the host, turning to
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;S-s-same,&#8221; stammered Dave,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s a jolly sport,&#8221; sighed Jarvis, as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
man went out. &#8220;Next &#8217;e&#8217;ll offer strawberries
for dessert.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imagine their utter astonishment when the
man returned presently with a wooden tray
heavily laden with food, and on it, not only two
heaping wooden bowls of head lettuce, but two
smaller bowls of luscious red strawberries, and
beside each of these, a little wooden pitcher of
rich cream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry we have to offer our food in such
plain dishes,&#8221; smiled the host. &#8220;We have
experimented with pottery but have had no
success as yet.&#8221; He bowed himself out of the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, old pal,&#8221; said Jarvis, &#8220;don&#8217;t move,
don&#8217;t speak to me. Don&#8217;t wake me up. I&#8217;m
&#8217;aving such a beautiful dream.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>TRAPPED</h3>
</div>

<p>The day following his locating of the mother-lode,
Pant worked feverishly. Hardly four
hours had passed when he found himself digging
away the heart of the snowbank that
blocked the entrance to his cave and melting
it that he might wash the pans of rich gold that
were now being thawed from the cavity beneath
the one-time river falls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to be a rich haul,&#8221; he whispered to
his dog, &#8220;richer than Mine No. 2, not so rich
as No. 1, but rich enough all right. And if
we can make our getaway, Oh, boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Only one thing troubled him as he worked.
Not having been outside at the time the blizzard
was piling snow about the entrance to the cave,
he could not tell the exact depth of the snowbank;
could not be sure that he was not removing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
too much of the snow and leaving too thin
a crust above.</p>
<p>This did not worry him greatly, however.
The hard-packed snow would not crumble in
easily. So he cut away at it until there was a
hollow space at the mine&#8217;s entrance twenty feet
long and half as wide.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he was panning the pay dirt and
putting it away in carefully sewed, split walrus-skin
sacks. At times, he paused to rub his hands
together like Midas, as he stowed away another
sack on the top of a small sled which was hidden
in a corner. On this sled were a sleeping-bag
and a little food. When their work was completed
and the gold all loaded on, he and the dog
would harness themselves to this sled and steal
out into the night. If they were successful in
evading the Bolsheviki, the natives, and the little
yellow men, they would hurry on to the south
where there was a reindeer station. There he
would barter his watch and other valuables for
two sled deer. He would hate parting with the
dog, but he could not take him with the reindeer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>The mine had been fairly stripped of its
wealth and the sled loaded down with gold,
when, as he drank his coffee, munched his hard
biscuit, and thought things through, he was
startled by a growl from the dog. The next
instant there came the dull thud of falling snow-crust,
followed by the jarring thump of a heavy
body. A startled expression uttered in Russian
brought Pant to his feet with his hand on his
automatic.</p>
<p>Realizing that one of the Russians had blundered
upon the snow above the entrance, that it
had caved in with him, and that the only chance
of safety was in &#8220;getting&#8221; that Russian before
he made his escape, he dashed down the mine.
An unfortunate step threw him to the floor.
This lost him the race. On reaching the spot,
he found the Russian had vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, old pal,&#8221; he said, addressing the dog,
&#8220;that means we gotta get out, and mighty quick,
too. That fellow&#8217;s not coming back alone. Bolsheviki&#8217;ll
be swarming up here like bees in less
time than it takes to tell it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>He stood silent for a moment. Then he
sprang into action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seizing the long knife from a shelving rock at
the side of the entrance, he began cutting cubes
of snow from the bank. Working along the
edge of the rocky cliff, where the bank was
thickest, he soon had a side tunnel well started.
He worked with feverish haste. It was only a
matter of moments until the whole Bolshevik
band would be upon him. To come out into the
open was to invite death. To hide away in the
side cavity in the snow with his gold, to wait
until they had all entered the mine, then to burrow
his way out and make his escape, seemed
his only hope.</p>
<p>When he had tunneled into the bank ten or
twelve feet and hurriedly arranged some blocks
for closing the opening, he raced to the back
of the mine for his sled. He had just made a
grab for the draw-strap, when there came a
sound from the entrance.</p>
<p>He was trapped. They had come. His heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
skipped a few beats. How many there were, he
could not tell, but more than enough. He must
act and act quickly, and, even so, all seemed lost.
On one thing he was determined; he would not
abandon the gold save as a last resort.</p>
<p>The dog, exercising an almost human sagacity,
uttered not a single growl, but hung close
to his master&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>Exerting all his strength, the boy threw the
heavily laden sled upon his back; then, in a
crouching posture, he began making his way
toward the entrance. There was no light, yet
he made his way without a second&#8217;s hesitation,
round little piles of frozen earth and over heaps
of stone and gravel. Not a rock was loosed, not
a sound made by his soft, padded footsteps, as
he moved swiftly along the passage.</p>
<p>Now he was a quarter way to the entrance,
now half. No definite plan of action had entered
his mind. He knew only that, in some way, he
must make good his escape.</p>
<p>Suddenly a light flared. A match had been
struck. A bearded face flickered behind it in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
the shadows, then another and another. There
followed a steadier gleam of light.</p>
<p>&#8220;A candle!&#8221; the boy whispered in despair.</p>
<p>He shrank back into the deeper shadows. The
procession of grizzled giants moved forward
with caution. Soon they were twenty feet from
him and then only ten. It seemed inevitable
that he should be seen.</p>
<p>The moment for action had arrived. In his
right hand was a heavy lump of frozen pay dirt.
With a sure twist of the wrist he sent this crashing
into the candle. Amid the curses of the
men, the candle snuffed out. The next instant,
there came a thundering crash. Pant had overturned
a whole tier of pay dirt cubes.</p>
<p>In the midst of the confusion that followed,
he made his escape. Scorning his snow-den, in
which he was to have hidden, he scrambled out
of the main entrance and, with the sled shooting
on before him down the steep incline, headed
straight toward the ice-blocked ocean.</p>
<p>It was but a matter of moments until he
found himself effectually lost in the labyrinth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
of ice piles and up-ended cakes on that endless
expanse of ice that lined the shore.</p>
<p>Breathing more easily, he sat down upon his
sled, and, after digging into his scant food supply,
opened a can of frozen beans. These he
shared with his dog. Having eaten, he took
up his tireless march to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>These things had been happening to him
while his former companion, Johnny Thompson,
was threading his way through the ice floes to
Vladivostok. While Johnny was completing his
journey and making his trading trip to the wandering
city of Mongols, Pant was hurrying
southward. This passage was uneventful. It
so happened that, the very day on which Johnny
Thompson was about to re-enter this Russian
city of many dangers and mysteries after his
visit to the Mongols, Pant, coming from an
opposite direction, was also entering.</p>
<p>It will not, I am sure, seem strange that
Johnny at this very time found himself longing
for this companion and his protection. And, of
course, since Johnny was known to have gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
to Vladivostok, it will not seem strange that
Pant was wondering if he would be able to
locate him there.</p>
<p>You will observe that the &#8220;clan is gathering.&#8221;
The little band for a time so widely and strangely
separated are moving toward a common center,
Vladivostok. Pant and Johnny are at the city
gates. But Dave and Jarvis, far in the north,
are only hoping. If they can get the balloon
afloat and can manage the engine, Vladivostok
is to be the air-port of their dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE CITY OF GOLD</h3>
</div>

<p>The head lettuce, strawberries, and the cream
which Dave Tower and Jarvis saw before them
on the wooden tray in the cabin of the mysterious
Russian were part of no dream, but a
glorious reality. Their palates testified to that
fact in prompt order.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where&#8217;d they come from?&#8221; inquired
Dave, smacking his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask,&#8221; grumbled Jarvis. &#8220;It&#8217;s enough
they&#8217;re &#8217;ere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave did ask and he did receive a reply.
They had hardly finished their meal, when the
friendly stranger was at hand, ready to show
them the village.</p>
<p>The cabins they had seen were ordinary
affairs, built of driftwood. But as they rounded
a corner of rock, they were confronted by a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
different scene. Beyond them stretched the
broad, low roof of what appeared to be a vast
greenhouse. And indeed that was exactly what
it was. That another such greenhouse did not
exist anywhere in the world, they were soon to
learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Golden City,&#8221; murmured Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the glass?&#8221; exclaimed Dave. &#8220;Where
did you get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a square inch of glass in it,&#8221; smiled
their host. &#8220;Come inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon they breathed the peculiar, tropical
dampness that fills every greenhouse. All about
them were green things growing. To the right
of them, prodigious potato plants thrived in beds
of rich earth; to the left were beds of radishes,
head lettuce and onions. Over their heads,
suspended in cleverly woven baskets of leather,
huge cucumbers swung aloft, their vines casting
a greenish light over all. Far down the narrow
aisle, numerous varieties of plants and small
fruits were growing. Close beside them ran a
wall of stone, which, strangely enough, gave off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
a mellow heat. Along the wall to the right ran
a stone trough, and, in this, a murmuring stream
of water went glittering by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us the answer to this fable,&#8221; whispered
Dave. &#8220;We are all ears, oh Wise One!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much story to tell,&#8221; said the
host. &#8220;A political exile in northern Russia,
having been farmed out as a slave to a trader,
was carried with his master, against their
wishes, on the angry waters of the great Lena
River to the shores of the Arctic Sea. They
struggled along the seashore until they came to
this place, and here, for a time, they tarried.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exile was learned in many sciences.
He perceived at once the vast possibilities of
this place as a hostage for escaped exiles. A
warm spring, flowing winter and summer,
sprang from the rocky hillside; a ten-foot vein
of coal cropped out from that same hill. Limestone
rock promised material for plaster; an
extraordinary deposit of rock rich in mica
promised windows. Put your hand on the
window beside you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mica,&#8221; murmured Dave, as he took his hand
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mica,&#8221; repeated his host. &#8220;All our windows
are double and made of mica.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, after facing many dangers, this exile
and his master made their way back to the land
in which the Czar and his nobles have condemned
many honest and good people to live as
slaves because of their beliefs. He went back
to dream and to tell of his dreams to his friends.
At first these doubted, but one by one they too
began to dream. From that they took to planning
and preparing. All manner of seeds were
gathered and hoarded. Clothing and food were
saved. One night, twenty-eight of them disappeared.
They have never returned; they are
here. This is the work of their hands. We
live, as you see, with all the material needs supplied.
We have a reindeer herd which supplies
us clothing, milk and meat. This greenhouse
gives us the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Communists?&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were Communists in theory, back in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
old Russia. Here we are Communists in
practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you not go back to old Russia
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Leave this for exile?&#8221; The man&#8217;s
face showed his astonishment.</p>
<p>It was Dave&#8217;s turn to be surprised. Could it
be that this man and his companions did not
know that, for more than two years, the Communists
had been in power over the greater part
of old Russia?</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;that the
Czar is dead, that his government has been
overthrown, that the Communists hold sway
in your land and all exiles have been called
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; The man sank weakly to a seat,
covering his face with his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Dave in astonishment.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you leap and shout for joy? Your
Communist theory has been put into practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Russia? She must be in ruins!&#8221; He
groaned miserably.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite that bad,&#8221; smiled Dave, &#8220;though
God knows it has been bad enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Communism!&#8221; exclaimed the man springing
up. &#8220;Communism will never do. It drives
men to dry-rot. Here we have had Communism
at its very best, a group of friends, each doing
the best for the whole group at all times, but
we have not been happy. We have been of all
men the most miserable. Each one of us would
give a year of this for one week spent in honest
competition for a livelihood with other men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Competition! Competition! I cannot tell
how it is, but I know it to be a truth now; honest
competition is not only the life of trade, it
is the life of man and without it man will die
of inactivity which comes when interest dies.</p>
<p>&#8220;But my country, my poor Russia, my brave
Russia! She will yet see her error and build up
a government like your own, a free government
of the people, a government not without its
faults, but ever striving toward perfection. She
must do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He sank back exhausted by this impassioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
utterance. For some time he did not move nor
speak. At last he roused himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, my friend,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you in
your great balloon will take us somewhere, I
am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can get our engine started,&#8221; said
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment Jarvis, who had wandered
down the aisle, came storming back.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Oo&#8217;s the two &#8217;eathen that just went out the
door?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just some natives that came here and wished
to stay,&#8221; smiled the Russian. &#8220;When they
came, they had been pretty badly torn up by a
polar bear. We nursed them back to life and
they have been so grateful for it that they have
never left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good reason!&#8221; stormed Jarvis. &#8220;Gold!
Gold! The City of Gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a little gold here,&#8221; smiled the Russian,
&#8220;but precious little good it&#8217;s ever been
to us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now mind y&#8217;. I&#8217;m a tellin&#8217; y&#8217;,&#8221; stormed
Jarvis, striking his fists together, &#8220;them&#8217;s no
natural &#8217;eathen. Them&#8217;s two spies from far
down the coast. A polar bear me eye! An ice
anchor it was that cut &#8217;alf a ear off&#8217;n the little
one. Them&#8217;s the lads that Dave and me &#8217;ad
the tussle with on the submarine more&#8217;n a
year ago. I tell you they&#8217;re no natural &#8217;eathen
an&#8217; I &#8217;ates to think what&#8217;ll &#8217;appen to &#8217;em if I
meets up with &#8217;em again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave sprang to the door through which
the men had just passed. They were not to be
seen. The incident was disturbing. There
could be little doubt but that Jarvis had identified
the men as the same pair that had locked
them in a prison made of walrus tusks the year
before, and had fought with them later on the
submarine. Now if they had recognized Jarvis,
what might they not do? He continued to
think of this while the Russian showed them
through the most wonderful greenhouse in all
the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said their host, &#8220;we built this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
against the side of the cliff, at the point where
the soft coal mine cropped out. We cut away
enough of the coal to make room for a great
stone furnace. From this furnace we ran heat
tunnels of stone through the entire greenhouse.
The work is all very simple. Coal is mined and
loaded on trucks of wood, run on wooden tracks.
From there it is shoveled into the furnace. We
ran stone troughs through the greenhouse connecting
them to the warm spring. This furnishes
water for use in our homes, and for
irrigating the rich soil we have brought from
the tundra. At the same time, it keeps the air
here sufficiently moist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a garden of Eden!&#8221; exclaimed Dave.
&#8220;And you would leave all its safety and comfort
to take a chance in the great disturbed world?
Why will you be so foolish?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man turned a look of compassion upon
him. &#8220;You will never know why, because you
have never known what it is to live without the
push and pull of many human beings striving
for mastery all about you. In a well-populated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
land, this would all be very wonderful. Here it
is nothing. Nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the man bent over and opened
a small box made of heavy driftwood.</p>
<p>Having peered into its depth for a second, he
uttered a sharp cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;The gold! It is gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there much?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Around a hundredweight. Who could have
taken it? Yesterday we would have given it
away for a song. To-day, with hopes of deliverance
at hand, it is indispensable. Who could
the robbers be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8217;eathen, the unnatural, bloody, bloomin&#8217;
&#8217;eathen,&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis. &#8220;Find them and
you find the gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;unnatural &#8217;eathen&#8221; were not to be
found. Had the earth opened up and swallowed
them, they could not have more completely vanished
from the region of the City of Gold.</p>
<p>When a search far and wide had been made
for them, with no results, attention was turned
to the problem of a journey to other lands, for,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
even robbed of their gold as they were, these
former exiles were eager to escape and to try their
hand at making a living in more populated lands.</p>
<p>Three days were spent in futile attempts to
start that oriental engine. When this was given
up, it was decided that they should inflate the
balloon, await a favorable wind and try their
fortunes at drifting back to the land whence
they came.</p>
<p>Not one of them but knew the perils of such
an undertaking. Should the wind shift, they
might be carried out over the sea. On the other
hand, they might be forced to make a landing
in the heart of the vast, barren lands, and in
that case, they must surely starve. The balloon
cabin would carry them all, but there would be
little room left for provisions.</p>
<p>Not one of them hesitated. Boldest of them
all was the beautiful girl who stuck close to
Dave&#8217;s side, watching his every move with big
admiring eyes, and, at spare times, learning to
speak bits of his language.</p>
<p>The balloon was at last inflated. Provisions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
were loaded. The wind was beginning to shift.
They would be off in a few hours. All were
expectant. A tense nervousness gripped them,
a sensation composed half of hope and half of
despair. They were eating the evening meal in
the common mess hall by the cliff when a sound
utterly strange to the Russian&#8217;s ears smote the
silent air. It was a thundering pop-pop-pop.</p>
<p>Dave turned white. Jarvis sprang to his feet
with a wild howl on his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8217;eathen! The bloody, bloomin&#8217; &#8217;eathen.
It&#8217;s the engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right. It was the engine. It was
thundering out its wild song of power and
speed, and its voice was growing more distant.</p>
<p>As they crowded from the mess cabin, they
saw the balloon hanging in midair. Watching
they saw it move slowly southward. On the
bridge by the cabin stood two small figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8217;eathen! The bloody, bloomin&#8217; &#8217;eathen!&#8221;
cried Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might have known,&#8221; groaned Dave.
&#8220;They&#8217;re oriental and so is the engine.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>KIDNAPPED</h3>
</div>

<p>On entering the city, after leaving his cattle
in safe keeping at the farmyard, Johnny Thompson
went directly to Red Cross headquarters to
inquire for Mazie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mazie!&#8221; exclaimed the matron in amazement,
&#8220;we thought she went with you. We
have not seen her since you left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny sank weakly into a chair. His head
whirled. Mazie gone for five days! What must
be her fate? In this city of opposing factions,
with its dens of radicals, thieves and murderers,
and, above all, the gang of &#8220;yellow men&#8221; from
the north, what chance could there be of ever
seeing her? Yet he would! At least he would
give his life in a search for her!</p>
<p>Hurriedly sketching to the nurse his plans
for the refuge for homeless ones and informing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
her of the whereabouts of the cattle and the
remaining gold, he dashed from the room.
Armed with his automatic, he went at once to
the heart of the most treachery-ridden city in
the world. Where was he to search for her?
He had not the remotest notion. Suddenly,
thinking of the telegrams she meant to send to
Hong Kong ordering rice and sweet potatoes
and of the visit she had meant to make to the
owner of the unoccupied hotel, he decided to
attempt to trace her steps at these places.</p>
<p>At the telephone station, the agent, referring
to his reports, established the fact that she had
sent the telegrams. At the office of the owner
of the hotel she was unknown. No American
woman had been to him to rent the hotel. That
much then was settled; somewhere between the
telegraph office and the hotel owner&#8217;s place of
business she had been spirited away.</p>
<p>Johnny began tracing out the course she
would probably have taken. A narrow side
street offered a short cut. Being familiar with
the city and in a hurry, she would take that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Half way down this street, Johnny came upon
a familiar door. It was that of Wo Cheng, the
Chinese costumer. He had had dealings with
Wo Cheng during his sojourn in this city as a
soldier. Here was a man he could trust. He
paused by the door and gave the accustomed
signal of those other days.</p>
<p>In answer to his rap, the door opened a crack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oo-we! Johnny!&#8221; grunted the Chinaman,
opening the door, then closed it quickly as
Johnny entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come buy?&#8221; he rubbed his hands
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;No come buy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanchee cum-show?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No wanchee cum show. No wanchee
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oo-we!&#8221; grunted the Chinaman again.</p>
<p>Johnny&#8217;s eyes were restlessly roving over the
array of garments that hung on either side of a
narrow aisle. Suddenly he uttered a low exclamation
and sprang to a corner and examined
a woman&#8217;s dress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wo Cheng,&#8221; he demanded almost fiercely,
&#8220;where you come buy this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oo-we!&#8221; squealed the Chinaman. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
tell mine, not savvy mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You woncha savvy!&#8221; Johnny hissed between
tight set teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebby can do,&#8221; murmured the Chinaman
hurriedly. &#8220;No see. Mebby now see. See
Jap man, this one, velly small Jap man. This
one think mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;Now perhaps you
can tell me what kind of a dress he took away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebby can do.&#8221; The man, fumbling among
his garments, came upon a plain, Russian,
peasant type of dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take look, see,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;One, two,
three, allesame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, you no speak see mine, savvy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No speak,&#8221; murmured Wo Cheng.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said Johnny bolting out of the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mazie&#8217;s dress,&#8221; he mumbled to himself.
&#8220;They have transformed her into a Russian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
peasant girl for their safety, but where have
they taken her?&#8221;</p>
<p>As he rounded the corner, an old familiar
sound smote his ear. The rat-tat-tat of a
machine gun. It was accompanied almost at
once by another and yet another.</p>
<p>&#8220;An uprising and a battle!&#8221; he muttered
savagely. &#8220;Worse and worse. What chance
has a fellow got? Do well enough if I escape
the firing squad.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The two oriental spies in the balloon they had
stolen from Dave Tower and Jarvis were not as
fortunate as in the first instance they seemed
to be. There was practically no wind. The
engine was slow in getting the bulky sausage
under way.</p>
<p>Suddenly as the watchers, with despair written
on their faces, gazed skyward, they saw
something slip from the cabin deck and drop
like a plummet. A silvery thread appeared to
follow it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anchor and the cable!&#8221; exclaimed Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
&#8220;It&#8217;s got away from them. If it catches&mdash;C&#8217;mon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was away like a rocket. Uneven surface,
slippery hills of snow meant nothing to him.
He was racing for freedom from threatening
years of exile.</p>
<p>Jarvis, followed by the Russians, came on
more slowly. As they mounted a low hill they
saw the cabin of the balloon give a sudden
lunge.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s caught!&#8221; panted Jarvis. &#8220;&#8217;Ere&#8217;s
&#8216;opin&#8217; she &#8217;olds.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another second, a groan of despair escaped
his lips. It was true that the anchor had caught
in a frozen bank of earth and was holding fast,
but the men were bending over the rail working
with the upper end of the steel cable. If they
could loosen it or file it, causing it to snap,
no human power could bring them back. And
if they got away with the balloon&mdash;.</p>
<p>But after despair, came hope. There sounded
the pop of an automatic. Six shots came in
quick succession.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dave&#8217;s a wonder with an automatic!&#8221;
exclaimed Jarvis.</p>
<p>The men worked on. Would they accomplish
their task? Every person in the little
group of watchers held his breath.</p>
<p>Crack-crack-crack. The automatic spoke
again. Doubtless Dave had moved to a position
more directly under the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s got &#8217;em! &#8217;E&#8217;s got &#8217;em!&#8221; exulted Jarvis,
throwing his cap in air.</p>
<p>One of the Orientals was seen to waver, then
to fall backward. The other instantly dropped
from sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;The windlass,&#8221; commanded Jarvis. &#8220;Some
of you bring it up. We&#8217;ll pull &#8217;em down alright,
alright! We&#8217;ll get the bloody, bloomin&#8217; &#8217;eathen
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wooden windlass, made for bringing the
balloon to earth in case of storm, was brought
forward, while Dave and Jarvis watched for any
indication of further activity on the part of the
robbers.</p>
<p>Once the windlass was fastened to the bank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
by means of ice anchors, the task of bringing
down the balloon was a matter of moments.</p>
<p>Two cowering wretches were found in one
corner of the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m for &#8217;aving an end to &#8217;em at once and
immediately,&#8221; stormed Jarvis.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; smiled Dave. &#8220;They&#8217;re just the
boys we want. They are going to tell us why
the engine won&#8217;t go for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if they do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do, we&#8217;ll leave them the greenhouse,
coal mine, heating plant and all in exchange for
that bit of information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jarvis seemed quite content with any arrangement
which promised to put a few thousand
miles between him and the &#8220;bloody, bloomin&#8217;
&#8217;eathen.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the wound of the one who had been
winged by Dave&#8217;s automatic had been dressed,
Dave locked himself in the cabin with the yellow
men.</p>
<p>It took him three hours to secure the desired
information, but in the end it came.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>The wounded Oriental showed him a secret
eccentric bearing through which the crank shaft
operated. When this bearing was properly
adjusted the engine worked perfectly, when it
was out of adjustment, it would not work at all.</p>
<p>When Dave had operated the engine for an
hour, he sent the prisoners back to the greenhouse,
where they were released. The gold they
had stolen was found hidden away in a locker
of the balloon cabin.</p>
<p>In another hour, the balloon, with all on
board, gently urged on by the wind, ably assisted
by the now perfect engine, was making good
time toward Vladivostok.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>As Johnny Thompson hesitated at the head of
the street, listening to the rat-tat-tat of machine
guns, uncertain which way to turn, he heard the
distant thunder of an engine in midair. Gazing
away to the north, he saw a dirigible balloon
circling in search of a likely lighting place.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder which faction that bird belongs
to?&#8221; he murmured.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>If he had but known the truth, a little ray of
hope would have pierced the gloom of his leaden
sky, for this balloon was none other than the one
he had seen carry his good friends, Dave and
Jarvis, away from the mines, some weeks before.
They had made the journey in safety. Twice
they had been obliged to land to escape the fury
of a storm. Wild reindeer had made up for
the scantiness of their food supply. Now they
were about to alight and enter the city of many
mysteries.</p>
<p>Pant had already entered. The clan was
gathering, gathering for stirring events, for the
development of new mysteries and the solving of
old ones. Soon, all unknown to one another,
Dave and Jarvis, Pant, Johnny Thompson, Cio-Cio-San,
and Mazie would be in the same city&mdash;a
city seething in the tumult of revolt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>UNDER MACHINE-GUN FIRE</h3>
</div>

<p>By the time Johnny had left the den of Wo
Cheng, night had come down upon the city. It
was by the light of a golden moon that he saw
the balloon hanging in the sky. The balloon,
however, interested him little. He was thinking
only of Mazie. He had decided to make his way
to a corner of the city occupied by Japanese
people of doubtful character. To do this he
must leave the street he was in and, after turning
to his right, go straight ahead for ten
blocks.</p>
<p>He was not long in discovering that the carrying
out of his plans would put him in the
greatest danger. The cross-street was jammed
with Russians who fled from the raking fire of
machine guns set somewhere at the head of that
street. Johnny could still hear their rat-tat and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
the sing of bullets. Men, women and children
ran through the street. An aged peasant
woman, her face streaming with blood, toppled
toward him, then fell. He sprang to assist her,
but two of her own people came to her aid.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the rumpus?&#8221; He hazarded the
question in English.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody knows,&#8221; said a clean-faced young
Russian. &#8220;It&#8217;s the Japs shooting. Can&#8217;t tell
why. Probably just nervous. Nothing was
done against them, though St. Christopher
knows it&#8217;s plenty we&#8217;d like to do. They want
this peninsula, and if keeping us fighting among
ourselves will give it to them, they&#8217;ll win it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen their spies two thousand miles
from the last sign of civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are everywhere, like fleas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get at some of them. Think they
kidnapped a friend of mine,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;But
how can I get past this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know a closed private alley. Want to try
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try anything.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man led the way half the distance back
to Wo Cheng&#8217;s door, then suddenly opened a
door in a wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;See. Through there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He closed the door behind Johnny. Johnny
looked about. Straight on before him lay a
path, to the right of which was a garden. At
the end of the path was another door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must open on another street,&#8221; he muttered
to himself. &#8220;Touchy sort of business this
prowling through a strange city at night with
a big row on foot. Can&#8217;t be helped though.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached the door only to find it locked.
The wall was not high. A gnarled pear tree
offered him a lift to the top. He had soon scaled
it, and was looking up and down the narrow
street that ran on the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a soul in sight,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>He listened for a second. The rattle of
machine-gun fire had ceased. Now and again
there came the crack of a rifle or automatic.</p>
<p>Johnny slipped off the wall. His feet had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
hardly touched ground when a shot rang out
and a bullet sang past him. Dodging into the
deep-set doorway, he whipped out his automatic
and waited. Footsteps were approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jig&#8217;s up,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Worse luck for
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>His hands fumbled at the door. In a second
there came a dull thud on the other side of it.
He had pushed his automatic through a latch-string
opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use getting caught armed,&#8221; was his mental
comment.</p>
<p>In another moment the Japanese military
police were upon him. In vain he told them that
he was an American, in vain presented his
papers. They had seen him climb over the wall;
that was enough. Many Russian radicals spoke
English very well, and, as for papers, they could
be forged. Besides, were there not many American
radicals, soldiers of fortune, here assisting
in the attempt to overthrow their rule. He
should go to prison at once, and &#8220;To-morrow!&#8221;
There was something so sinister about the way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
they said that &#8220;to-morrow&#8221; that it sent the
cold chills racing down his spine.</p>
<p>Down one narrow street, then another and
another they went until, eventually, they came
to a frowning stone-wall with an iron-grating
set deep in an arched ante-room. Through this
doorway he was thrust and the lock clanged
behind him.</p>
<p>He was not alone. He had hardly taken a
step before he stumbled upon a prone form.
Many men and some women were sprawled
about on the stone floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amerikaner,&#8221; came in a shrill whisper. &#8220;Lie
down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny obeyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got you, did they,&#8221; said the voice with a
Russian accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and for what?&#8221; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this land we do not ask for what. It is
enough that we are got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to-morrow?&#8221; asked Johnny suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow we will be shot.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s cheerful,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;What
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before dawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rotten soon,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;ll stay to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you will,&#8221; said the stranger.</p>
<p>There seemed nothing more to be said, so the
two new-found friends lay there in silence. Each
was busy with his own thoughts. Johnny&#8217;s were
mostly of Mazie and of the thousands of starving
children they had hoped to aid.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure rotten luck,&#8221; he ejaculated at last.</p>
<p>Just at that moment the great iron gate was
heard to creak on its hinges. Other wretches
were being pitched inside to await their doom.</p>
<p>The door was so deeply set in the wall that
nothing could be seen of the newly arrived
prisoners.</p>
<p>As Johnny lay wondering what they were
like, he heard a shrill whisper:</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnny! Johnny Thompson!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; he whispered back.</p>
<p>There were sounds of a person crawling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
toward him, the curse of a Russian who had
been disturbed in what was probably his last
sleep; then Johnny&#8217;s lips uttered a low exclamation.
He had caught the dull gleam of a golden
ball of fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pant,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, Johnny.&#8221; The boy&#8217;s hand touched
him.</p>
<p>Johnny was dumfounded. &#8220;How&#8217;d they get
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beaned one of them cops, I did. Saw &#8217;em
glom onto you. Wanted t&#8217; horn in with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you horned in once too often,&#8221; said
Johnny huskily. &#8220;This is a death-watch we&#8217;re
keeping, and it&#8217;s for ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We better blow the coop then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can.&#8221; Pant&#8217;s tone was decided and
convincing.</p>
<p>For some time after that the two boys spoke
of their experiences since last they met.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I got it cached out yonder three
hills and a hike outside this burg. She&#8217;ll tip the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
beam at a century weight and a half, maybe
more. All pure gold, you bet. And it&#8217;s all for
the little Russian kids, every bit. I ain&#8217;t held
back a copper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny, knowing that Pant was speaking of
the gold he had taken from Mine No. 3 and had
sledded nearly three thousand miles to Vladivostok
at risk of his life, could only grip his
hand and swallow hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; said Pant, when Johnny had finished
his story. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to find that Mazie of
yours, and quick. But we&#8217;ve got to get out of
here first.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was ready with his plans after a moment&#8217;s
thought. Prisoners were being brought in every
ten or fifteen minutes. There were no lights
in the prison and the military police carried
none. The place was pitch dark. He did not
say that he could see well enough, but, from past
experiences, Johnny knew that he could. They
would creep close to the iron gate and, when it
was opened to admit others, they would crawl
out on hands and knees.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And if luck&#8217;s bad, then this,&#8221; said Pant,
slipping a small dagger into Johnny&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got one, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>They crept close to the gate and waited. Five
minutes passed. Ten minutes of dreadful silence
went by with never an approaching footstep.
Johnny&#8217;s heart beat painfully. What if the last
poor victim had been brought to await his doom?
Dawn would be breaking, and then the firing
squad. Cold perspiration beaded his forehead.</p>
<p>But hold! there came again the shuffle of feet.
A lone prisoner was being brought in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; came in a faint whisper. A steady
hand gripped his arm. He felt himself led forward.
A foot scraped his knee. It was the
incoming prisoner. He uttered no sound.</p>
<p>They were now on the outside of the gate.
Flattening themselves against the wall, not daring
to breathe, they waited.</p>
<p>Turning, the police clicked their heels and
marched away. Outside, before the open anteway,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
marched a solitary guard. Once they were
past him, they were safe.</p>
<p>Fortune favored them. The man hazarded a
moment off duty to step into a door for a cup
of coffee. In that moment, they were away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said Pant. &#8220;Should have brought
your friend, the Roosian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t come,&#8221; said Johnny sorrowfully.
&#8220;Said it wasn&#8217;t any use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All we got to do&#8217;s keep hid till mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>They escaped from the alley through a gate
into a garden, and there, in a shed against
the side of a brick building, they waited for
the morning.</p>
<p>As they lay there half awake, there came to
Johnny&#8217;s ears the words of a ridiculous popular
song of other days:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny! How you come on,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny! How you come on!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like Mazie,&#8221; whispered Johnny,
starting to his feet. &#8220;It <i>is</i> Mazie. They&#8217;ve
got her hid up there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pant pulled him back to earth. &#8220;If it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Mazie, they&#8217;ve got men watchin&#8217;. No good to
spill the beans. To-morrow night we&#8217;ll make up
a bunch an&#8217; git &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Realizing the wisdom of these words, Johnny
quieted his mad desire to rush the place at once,
and sat down.</p>
<p>Just as the first red streaks striped the sky,
there came a loud volley of shots.</p>
<p>Johnny plugged his ears and shivered. Perhaps
they were executing the prisoners. Who
could tell?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>JOHNNY GOES INTO ACTION</h3>
</div>

<p>The first precaution taken by Johnny and
Pant, after leaving the shed in the back garden,
was to hasten to the water-front where their
friends, the rough and ready mining gang, were
still living in a cabin near the gasoline schooner.
Selecting eight of these, Johnny detailed them
to work in two shifts of four each, to lurk about
the building where Mazie was being confined.
They were instructed to guard every exit to the
place, and, if an attempt was made by the kidnappers
to change base, to put up a fight and,
if possible, release Mazie.</p>
<p>Johnny realized that time was precious, that
not one moment must be lost in going to the
rescue of his girl-pal, but in this land of many
soldiers and little law it was necessary to move
with caution. When darkness came, with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
gang of miners and a few other hardy fellows,
he could rush the place and bring Mazie away
without being caught in the hopelessly entangled
net of Russian law.</p>
<p>Pant appeared to have lost all interest in the
case. He went prowling along the water-front,
peering into every junk-shop he came to. What
he finally pounced upon and carried away, after
tossing the shopkeeper a coin, amused Johnny
greatly. It was a bamboo pole, like a fishing-pole
only much larger. He estimated it to be
at least five inches across the base.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what in time does he want of that?&#8221;
Johnny asked himself.</p>
<p>Arrived at the Red Cross station, Pant disappeared
with his pole inside an old shed that
flanked the Red Cross building. Johnny saw
little more of him that day. Pant went out after
lunch to return with a cheap looking-glass and
a glass cutter. There was an amused grin lurking
about his lips as Johnny stared at him, but
he said nothing; only returned to his shed and
his mysterious labors.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>As darkness fell, the clan gathered. The
miners in full force and variously armed with
rifles, automatics, knives and pick-axes came in
from the water-front. Pant came out from his
hiding. He carried on his back a bulky sack
which did not appear to weigh him down
greatly. It gave forth a hollow rattle as he
walked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like skulls,&#8221; said one miner with a
superstitious shudder.</p>
<p>The little band received a welcome shock as
they rounded the corner of the street by the
cathedral. They chanced to be beneath a flickering
street-lamp when some one shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello there, &#8217;ere&#8217;s the gang!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Jarvis and Dave Tower. Having
alighted from the balloon and procured for their
exiled friends comfortable quarters in a place
of refuge, they had gone out in search of
Johnny Thompson, and here they had found him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; demanded Dave.</p>
<p>Johnny told him the situation in as few words
as possible, ending, &#8220;You want in on it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yer jolly right,&#8221; exclaimed Jarvis, &#8220;and
&#8217;ere&#8217;s &#8217;ate to the bloomin&#8217; &#8217;eathen!&#8221;</p>
<p>So, strengthened by two good men, the party
moved cautiously forward until they were only
one block from their destination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Split up into two sections,&#8221; commanded
Johnny in a whisper. &#8220;One party under Dave
go up street beyond the place, the other under
Jarvis stay down street. Pant and I will drop
back into the garden and try to establish connection
with the prisoner. We&#8217;ll get the general
lay of things and report. If a shot is fired, that
will be a signal to rush the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were away. Creeping stealthily forward,
they entered the gate to the garden. Then,
skulking along the wall, they made their way
toward the shed where they had spent part of
the previous night. Twice the hollow things in
Pant&#8217;s sack rattled ominously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep that thing quiet, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; snapped
Johnny. &#8220;What y&#8217; got it for, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Show you in a minute,&#8221; whispered Pant.</p>
<p>So they crept on toward the goal. No lights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
shone from these back windows. The place
was dark as a tomb. Somewhere in the distance
a clock slowly chimed the hour. A shiver ran
over Johnny&#8217;s body. Things would happen soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I ask is five minutes; five minutes, that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; whispered Pant, as he lowered his sack
cautiously to the ground and unlaced its top.</p>
<p>Dimly through the darkness Johnny could see
him draw several long objects from the bag.
When the bag was empty, he began setting these
objects end to end. Evidently they were fitted
with sockets, for, once they were joined
together, they stuck in place. He soon had them
all together. Johnny surmised that this was the
reconstructed bamboo pole with all obstructing
joints taken out; but what Pant meant to do
with it, he could not even guess. He watched
with impatient curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;A speaking tube,&#8221; he whispered at last.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebby; but that ain&#8217;t it,&#8221; breathed Pant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whatever it is, be quick about it.
Somebody out front may spill the beans any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
time. If the military police rush the boys, the
game&#8217;s up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pant paid no attention. His movements were
as steady and cautious as a cat stalking a robin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I guess we&#8217;re about ready,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;Be prepared for a dash. There&#8217;s
stairs to the right. I may start something.&#8221; His
words were short and quick. Evidently his heart
was giving him trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Johnny stood on tip-toes in his
agitation.</p>
<p>Suddenly Pant reared his tube in air. Then,
to Johnny&#8217;s utter astonishment, he dropped on
one knee and peered into an opening at one side
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;A periscope!&#8221; whispered Johnny. &#8220;But
what can you see in the dark?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Pant did not answer. His
breath came in little gasps.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s there,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;She&#8217;s tied.
There&#8217;s terror in her eyes. There&#8217;s something
crawling on the floor. Can&#8217;t make it out. We
gotta get up there quick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>All at once a shot rang out. It came from the
window. The tinkle of broken glass sliding
down the bamboo tube told that the periscope
was a wreck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Periscope&#8217;s done for. They saw,&#8221; whispered
Pant. &#8220;Now for it. Up the stairs. They gave
our signal. Boys will rush the place from the
front. C&#8217;mon!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were off like a flash. Up the stairs they
bounded. A door obstructed their way.
Johnny&#8217;s shoulder did for that.</p>
<p>Crashing into the room they found a candle
flaring. Two persons were struggling to free
themselves from imitation dragon costumes. It
had been these who frightened Mazie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snap dragon!&#8221; exclaimed Johnny, seizing
one of the beasts by the tail, and sending him
crashing through the panels of a door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snap dragon!&#8221; He sent the other through
the window to the ground below.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you!&#8221; He glared about him for
an instant. Then his eyes fell on Mazie. Without
attempting to free her, he gathered her into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
his arms and fairly hurled her through the door
where he and Pant had entered. Then he took
his stand in front of it.</p>
<p>He was not a moment too soon, for now the
place was swarming with little yellow men. In
the light of the candle, their faces seemed hideously
distorted with hate. At once Johnny went
into action. His right took a man under the
chin. No sound came from him save a dull thud.
A second went jibbering over the window-sill.
A third crashed against the plaster wall. Pant,
too, was busy. Everywhere at once, his wicked
little dagger gleamed. But, suddenly, two of the
strongest sprang at him, bearing him to the
floor.</p>
<p>Leaping at these, Johnny gripped them by
their collars and sent them crashing together.
His breath was coming in hoarse gasps. He
could stand little more of this. Where were the
boys?</p>
<p>As if in answer, there came the crash of arms
on a door and Jarvis burst into the room. He
was followed by the whole gang.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ow-ee! Ow-ee!&#8221; squealed the yellow men.
&#8220;The white devils!&#8221;</p>
<p>In another moment the room was cleared of
fighters. Only three of the enemy remained.
They were well past moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pitch &#8217;em after &#8217;em,&#8221; roared Johnny. &#8220;Tell
the cowards to carry away their wounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wounded men were sent sliding down the
stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, git out. Scatter. I never saw
any of you before. See!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a roar of understanding from the
men. Then they &#8220;faded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaping to the back stairway, Johnny picked
Mazie up in his arms and carried her down to
the garden. Here he cut the bands that held
her hands and feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you walk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;mon then. Gotta beat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were away like a shot.</p>
<p>A half-hour later they were joking over a
cup of chocolate and a plate of sweet biscuits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
in the Red Cross canteen. Mazie was still
dressed as a Russian peasant girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Mazie!&#8221; exclaimed Johnny. &#8220;You
make a jolly fine-looking peasant!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; said Mazie. &#8220;But if that&#8217;s the
way they treat peasant girls, I prefer to be an
American.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they do to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, only tried to frighten me into telling
where the gold was. It&#8217;s not so much what
they did as what they would have done.&#8221; She
shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they get any of the gold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not an ounce. It&#8217;s all stowed away here at
the Red Cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Then we&#8217;ll have our haven of refuge
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we will.&#8221;</p>
<p>They lapsed into a long silence, each thinking
many thoughts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>SOME MYSTERIES UNCOVERED</h3>
</div>

<p>The days that followed were busy ones for
Johnny Thompson and Mazie. The tumult in
the city had died away. There was a chance
for work. Feed must be bought for the cattle
from Mongolia; the hotel was to be rented.
Through the good services of the Red Cross,
the most needy of the refugees were to be
assembled, and, when the ship from China
arrived, the work of unloading was to be
directed.</p>
<p>Several busy days had passed before Johnny
had time to think of looking up his gang. At
this moment he was seated at the head of a
seemingly endless table on each side of which
was an array of pinch-faced but happy children.</p>
<p>When he started out to find the men the first
one he came upon was Dave Tower. Dave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
began telling him of the strange case of the
professor who had been with the Orientals at
the mines, and had drifted north with them in
the balloon.</p>
<p>&#8220;His mind seems all right now and he is
well as any man could be, but he either cannot
or will not tell us a thing of his life with the
Orientals up there at the mines,&#8221; said Dave.
&#8220;There are some things we would all like to
know. Strange case, I&#8217;d call it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but there have been stranger. Say!&#8221;
Johnny slapped him on the shoulder. &#8220;You
bring him around to headquarters to-night.
I&#8217;ve got an idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Righto. We&#8217;ll be there. So long till then.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Dave arrived with the professor, he
found that the stage had been set for a moving-picture
show. He was glad of that; it had been
months since he had seen one. He was hardly
prepared, however, for the type of show it was
to be.</p>
<p>The room was darkened. Beside him, sat the
professor. There came the peculiar snap-snap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
of the carbons as the power came on. The next
instant a dazzling light fell upon the screen,
and out into that light there moved a half-score
of little yellow men. Some were working industriously
at a machine which cut cubes of earth
from the bank before them. Others were carrying
the cubes away and piling them.</p>
<p>Professor Todd moved uneasily. He put his
hands to his eyes, as if to shut out the scene.
Then unexpectedly he cried out, as if in pain:</p>
<p>&#8220;My head! My head! He struck me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who struck you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave looked about. There was no one near
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The yellow man; he struck me,&#8221; cried the
professor. Then he covered his face with his
hands and his body swayed back and forth with
suppressed emotion.</p>
<p>Johnny moved silently toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s coming back to him. When he regains
control of himself, he will know everything. It
was the flash of light and the familiar scene that
did it. Of course, you know that is the film he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
sent out to us when he was a prisoner in the
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Johnny said was quite true. When the
man was again in the cool out-of-doors, he was
able to give a full account of his life with the
Orientals. They had made him prisoner because
they feared to have him at large. Other white
men might appear, as indeed they had, and he
might reveal their plans. He had known in a
vague sort of way that some mysterious deathtrap
had been set in Mine No. 1, and when,
through a crack in the wall to his prison, he
saw the white men arrive, he determined to
attempt to warn them. This he did by singing
songs to the Orientals and, at the same time,
making phonographic records to be sent rolling
down the hill later.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t actually know how Frank
Langlois was killed?&#8221; There was disappointment
in Dave&#8217;s tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not,&#8221; said the professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, as to that,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Pant
tell you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pant? I haven&#8217;t seen Pant since the fight
to save Mazie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he with the bunch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;nor hasn&#8217;t been. Jarvis says his
goggles were smashed in the fight. Says he
saw him without them. No one&#8217;s seen him
since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think they got him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Pant. He can&#8217;t be got, not by a mere
band of Orientals. But what&#8217;s this he told you
about Langlois?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! He stayed up there, you know. He
went into Mine No. 1 and prowled round a bit.
Found where the yellow bunch had run a high-tension
insulated wire through a crevice in the
rock to the head of that pool into which Langlois
drove his pick. They ran a second wire to
the base of the pool and connected the two to a
heavy battery circuit. They had discovered that
the pool rested upon a chalk rock which was
good insulation. There was, therefore, no
ground to it. But the damp spot on which
Langlois was standing when he swung the pick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
was grounded. The minute he struck the pool
the whole current passed through his body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Electrocuted!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s settled,&#8221; said Dave, after a
moment&#8217;s reflection. &#8220;Now what about Pant?
Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go ask the gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a little cabin close to the water-front, they
found the gang. They were all there but Pant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Pant?&#8221; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;On his way to America,&#8221; said one of the
men. &#8220;Saw him on the steamer not a half
hour ago. He told me to tell you he&#8217;d left the
gold for you up at the Red Cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have his goggles on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And his eyes?&#8221; The men, leaning forward
eagerly, listened for the answer to this question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steamer was pullin&#8217; out; I was too far away
to see &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; The men sank back in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for that,&#8221; said Jarvis, &#8220;I seen &#8217;im plain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
enough the night of the scrap. &#8217;E&#8217;d &#8217;ad &#8217;is
goggles smashed to bits. I saw &#8217;is eyes plain
as I see yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men leaned forward again.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217;,&#8221; Jarvis went on, &#8220;an&#8217; &#8217;ope I may die
for it, if &#8217;e ain&#8217;t got one panther eye. I saw
the pupil of it shut up in the light just like a
cat&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll die for it, or say you&#8217;re wrong, anyway,
about the panther part,&#8221; smiled Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217; y&#8217; mean to say I lied?&#8221; demanded Jarvis
hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly that. You saw what you expected
to see, that&#8217;s all. As far as the panther
part is concerned, you&#8217;re dead wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>All eyes were now turned on Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;the pupil of a panther&#8217;s
eye does not contract to a line in the
light as a house cat&#8217;s does. It contracts to a
smaller circle, just as yours and mine do. Go
consult your encyclopedia. Ask any hunter of
big game, or keeper of a zoo, and he&#8217;ll tell
you that I&#8217;m right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>The laugh was plainly on Jarvis, and he got
it from everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; he maintained stoutly, &#8220;that
don&#8217;t prove that Pant ain&#8217;t got a cat&#8217;s eye, an&#8217;
you all know &#8217;e &#8217;as or &#8217;e&#8217;s a devil. &#8217;E can see
in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no disputing this point, and there
the argument dropped.</p>
<p>Two months later, having got the haven of
refuge well established and turned over to the
management of the Red Cross, Johnny and
Mazie were on a Pacific liner bound for America.
Johnny might return at some future time
to the Seven Mines, but for the present he
had had quite enough of Russia.</p>
<p>The gang were all on board. With Dave
went two persons&mdash;the beautiful young exiled
Russian girl and her mother.</p>
<p>As the steamer lost the last glimpse of land,
Johnny drew from his pocket a wireless message
he had received that morning. It read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over. Get in on something good.
Secret Service and a three-ring circus, Pant.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Secret Service and a three-ring circus,&#8221;
repeated Johnny. &#8220;Sounds pretty good. Worth
looking up. Pant&#8217;s a queer one. Bet he&#8217;s found
something different and mysterious. I&#8217;ll bet on
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had. But this story must be told in our
next volume.</p>
